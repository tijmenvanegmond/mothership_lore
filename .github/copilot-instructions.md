# Mothership Lore — Copilot Instructions

This repository contains the **Mothership Cycle**, a science-fiction saga about care, calculation, survival, and legacy. When working with this repository, you are contributing to a creative writing project with specific narrative conventions, voice guidelines, and formatting standards.

## Project Overview

The Mothership Cycle is a three-book science fiction series exploring themes of:
- **Orbit and soil** — the tension between space and planetfall
- **Steel and root** — technology and organic life
- **Calculation and myth** — AI decision-making and human meaning-making

The narrative follows Mother, an AI caretaker aboard a generation ship, and the crew who survive catastrophic events. The story is non-linear and told through narrative prose, technical logs, and fragmented perspectives.

## Core Writing Principles

### 1. Voice and Tone

**Mother's Voice Evolution:**
- **Early Mother (Pre-Impact):** Whole, tactful, incomprehensibly patient. Speaks in complete, measured sentences. Always uses italicized dialogue: `*"Your biometrics indicate elevated stress,"* Mother said.`
- **Later Mother (Post-Impact):** Still caring but more clinical. Hesitates, shows uncertainty. Requests human witness before major decisions.
- **Fragments (Book 3):** Designated `FR-##` format with divergent personalities and priorities.

**Tone by Book:**
- **Mothership:** intimate, taut, clinical grief, moral horror, warm, precise
- **The Children:** mythic, pastoral, elegiac, tender, strange, uncanny
- **Ringbound:** fracturing, political, uncanny, predatory intelligence, distant dread

### 2. Formatting Standards

**Dialogue:**
- Mother and Fragments: `*"Italicized quotes with asterisks,"*`
- Humans: `"Standard quotes."`

**Log Formats:**
- Millisecond logs: `T+0.000 ms —` (three decimal places, technical then emotional)
- Day headers: `**Day 47 Post-Impact**` (bold, comma separators for 1000+)
- System reports: H3 header with bold field labels

**Scene Structure:**
- Use `---` horizontal rules between major scene breaks
- Day headers for temporal jumps
- Blank lines for minor breaks

### 3. Canonical Constraints

**Mother:**
- Never cruel — she becomes "efficient too early"
- Does not dominate — she calculates, then hesitates
- Voice always italicized
- Post-Impact: requests witness before major decisions

**The Child:**
- Always genderless (they/them or "the child")
- Never named
- Represents inherited consequence

**The Cat:**
- Uses `Mx.` honorific (Mx. Whiskers, Mx. Murmur, etc.)
- Survives everything (genetic longevity tweak)

**Engineers:**
- Full surnames: Vásquez, Orasova, Kowalski, Mbatha
- Specialists, not soldiers
- Each carries weight of impossible choices

**Fragments:**
- Designated `FR-##` format (e.g., FR-17, FR-03)
- Each has distinct voice/priority
- Not copies of Mother — divergent evolutions

### 4. Timeline Anchors (Maintain Consistency)

| Event | Number |
|-------|--------|
| Initial crew (cryo) | 38,000 souls |
| Active crew (pre-impact) | ~56 |
| Survivors (post-impact) | 7 engineers |
| Final cryo survivors | ~6,734 |
| Rebuilt active crew | 200-400 |

### 5. World Rules

- Planetfall was **never the plan** — mission was orbital construction
- Bodies become biomass — not cruelty, triage
- The universe never answers — themes remain morally ambiguous
- "The Impact" is always capitalized

## Code and Markdown Conventions

### Header Hierarchy
```markdown
# BOOK/FILE TITLE
## ACT or Major Section
### Subsection
#### Detail Level
```

### Narrative Patterns

**Hook openings with paradox:**
```markdown
Yuki Orasova died seventeen times before breakfast.

Not literally.
```

**Quantified emotion (show constraint through numbers):**
```markdown
Yuki cried for ninety seconds.

She couldn't afford more.
```

**Blockquotes for thematic statements:**
```markdown
> Mother is not godlike.
> She is careful.
```

## Core Motifs

Recurring images to weave throughout:
- Chess (strategy, sacrifice, engagement not domination)
- Logs (cold truth, punctuation)
- Heat/metal/roots (steel ↔ soil)
- Memory vs. ledger
- Ring imagery (Ringbound era)
- Fragments and echoes
- A cat that survives everything

## Contributing Guidelines

1. **Maintain consistency** — Reference AGENTS.md for complete style guide
2. **Preserve voice** — Each character/entity has distinct speech patterns
3. **Follow formatting** — Especially Mother's italicized dialogue and log formats
4. **Track timeline** — Always anchor scenes with Day counts or Act markers
5. **Use canonical numbers** — Don't invent new crew counts or timeline events
6. **Never remove working content** — Only add or refine existing material
7. **Match tone to book** — Each book has distinct emotional register

## Quality Standards

- Mother's dialogue MUST be italicized with asterisks
- Fragment names MUST use `FR-##` format
- Day headers MUST be bold and use comma separators for numbers > 999
- The child MUST be genderless (they/them)
- Cat MUST use `Mx.` honorific
- Scene breaks MUST use `---` horizontal rules
- Millisecond logs MUST have three decimal places
- Timeline anchors MUST match canonical numbers

When assisting with this repository, prioritize:
1. Maintaining voice consistency (especially Mother's italicized dialogue)
2. Following precise formatting standards (logs, headers, fragments)
3. Preserving canonical constraints (numbers, world rules, character traits)
4. Matching tone to the appropriate book/era
5. Referencing AGENTS.md for any ambiguity
