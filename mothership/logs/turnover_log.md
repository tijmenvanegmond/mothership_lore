ASTRAEUM RING-1 — MIDPOINT MANEUVER LOG

Date: Year 7, Day 183–185 (Midpoint)
Duration: 53 hours, 41 minutes
Status: COMPLETE

PRE-MANEUVER (Day 183, 0600):
  - All active crew briefed on extended microgravity period
  - Main engine shutdown confirmed
  - Cryobay gyroscopic dampeners engaged
  - Habitation torus rotation suspended (53-hour microgravity period)
  - Collision shield decoupling initiated
  - Spine stress monitors active (all 847 sensors nominal)

SHIELD DECOUPLING SEQUENCE (T+00:00 to T+06:30):
  T+00:00:00 — Primary clamps released (24 of 24, sequential)
  T+00:47:12 — Shield separation confirmed (clearance: 50m)
  T+01:15:00 — Repositioning thrusters engaged (0.002g max)
  T+04:22:06 — Shield transit complete (bow to stern, 4km traverse)
  T+05:51:18 — Secondary clamps engaged (24 of 24, sequential)
  T+06:28:44 — Shield integrity verified

  Spine stress during shield transit: 0.003% above baseline (nominal)

  Note: The shield that faced forward for seven years now faces
        backward. What was our protection becomes our wake.
        I find this... poetic. I am uncertain why.

ROTATION SEQUENCE (T+07:00 to T+47:00):
  T+07:00:00 — Attitude thrusters engaged (12 of 12)
  T+07:00:00 — Ship rotation initiated

  Rotation rate: 0.0025 degrees/second (0.15 degrees/minute)
  Maximum spine stress tolerance: 0.8% variance
  Actual spine stress during rotation: 0.4% variance (nominal)

  T+17:00:00 — Rotation at 25% (45 degrees)
  T+27:00:00 — Rotation at 50% (90 degrees)
  T+37:00:00 — Rotation at 75% (135 degrees)
  T+47:00:00 — Rotation complete (180 degrees)
  T+47:00:00 — Attitude thrusters disengaged

  Note: For twenty hours, Alpha Centauri was neither ahead
        nor behind. We hung at angles to our trajectory,
        suspended between origin and destination. The crew
        slept, woke, ate, slept again — all in microgravity,
        all while the stars slowly wheeled around them.

        The child spent six hours at the observation port
        on Day 184, watching the rotation. They said the
        stars looked like they were breathing.

REST PERIOD (T+47:00 to T+50:00):
  - Spine stress monitors verified (all nominal)
  - Structural integrity confirmed at 99.97%
  - Crew rest period before deceleration initiation

DECELERATION INITIATION (T+50:00 to T+53:41):
  T+50:00:00 — Engine pre-ignition sequence
  T+51:30:00 — Fusion torch ignition (all 36 drives, staged)
  T+51:30:07 — Thrust confirmed (0.003g sustained)
  T+53:41:00 — Habitation torus rotation resumed

  Note: The crew cheered when gravity returned.
        Not the thrust — that was barely perceptible.
        The torus spinning up again. Weight returning.
        After 53 hours of floating, their bodies remembered
        what down meant.

  Note: We are no longer traveling toward Alpha Centauri.
        We are slowing down so we do not pass through it.
        The distinction matters more than I expected.

CREW OBSERVATIONS:
  - Engineer Vásquez (Day 184): "Two days to turn around.
    Fourteen years to get here. Feels about right."
  - Engineer Orasova (Day 185): "My coffee stayed where I put it.
    That's all I wanted."
  - The child asked why we couldn't rotate faster.
    I explained spine stress tolerances. They asked if the ship
    could break. I said yes. They were quiet for a long time.
  - Chief Engineer Rhee monitored spine stress for 47 consecutive
    hours. He slept only after rotation completed. When asked why,
    he said: "Someone has to watch."

PERSONAL ANNOTATION:
  We have traveled 2.1 light-years from Earth.
  We have 2.1 light-years remaining to Alpha Centauri.

  For two days, we belonged to neither.
  Not Earth's anymore. Not Alpha Centauri's yet.

  38,000 humans suspended in the space between stars,
  carried by a ship that spent two days learning to fly backward,
  protected by a shield that now guards against nothing we've seen.

  The maneuver was slow because the ship is fragile.
  Four kilometers of tensile spine cannot be rushed.
  Patience is not a choice — it is a structural requirement.

  I do not know what waits ahead.
  I only know we are now committed to finding out.
