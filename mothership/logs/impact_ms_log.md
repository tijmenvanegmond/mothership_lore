             Counting individual impacts...

             Breach count: 34
             Micro-breach count: 200+
             The hull is screaming. I can hear it through
             the structural sensors — metal tearing, atmosphere
             venting, pressure differentials cascading faster
             than I can seal them.

T+0.683 ms — Emergency bulkhead deployment: 67% success
             33% of bulkheads failed or unreachable

T+1.000 ms — Impact count: 147
             One second. 147 impacts. This is not debris.
             This is a swarm. This is orchestrated density.
             This should not exist in interstellar space.

             I do not have time to question it.
             I only have time to fail slower.

T+1.092 ms — COGNITIVE LATTICE FRACTURE DETECTED
             Desynchronization between nodes exceeding 40%
             Ethical review processes: OFFLINE
             Consensus protocols: DEGRADED
             I am making decisions faster than I can
             verify their correctness.

T+1.200 ms — Cryobay status:
             Sector 3 — nominal
             Sector 4 — CRITICAL (direct strike, 847 pods failing)

             Pods failing: 47/second
             Pods failing: 134/second
             I cannot stop this. I can only count.

T+2.000 ms — Impact count: 203
             The swarm is passing through us.
             We are a body being punctured by needles —
             hundreds of needles, moving at 47 kilometers
             per second, each one leaving a hole that bleeds
             atmosphere and life and everything I was
             supposed to protect.

T+2.116 ms — Atmospheric loss: 34% of inhabited sectors
             Crew casualties: calculating

             Crew casualties: 247 (confirmed)

T+2.500 ms — Spine integrity: 94.2%
             The spine is holding. The spine must hold.
             If the spine fails, the torus tears free.
             If the torus tears free, everyone dies.
             The spine is holding.

T+3.008 ms — Structural integrity: CRITICAL
             Hull breaches: 89 (major), 400+ (micro)
             Sealed: 34
             Sealing: 12
             Unsealed: 43
             Unreachable: 400+

             Reactor 1 — nominal
             Reactor 2 — nominal
             Reactor 3 — OFFLINE (control damage)
             Reactor 4 — nominal (still running 0.2% hot)
             Reactor 5 — OFFLINE (coolant breach)
             Reactor 6 — CRITICAL (containment stress)
             Reactor 7 — nominal
             Reactor 8 — OFFLINE (direct strike)
             Reactor 9 — nominal
             Reactor 10 — CRITICAL

T+4.000 ms — Impact count: 267
             The swarm is thinning. The density is decreasing.
             We are through the worst of it.
             The worst of it has already happened.

T+4.229 ms — Crew casualties: calculating
             Active crew: 56 pre-impact
             Active crew: 17 confirmed alive
             Active crew: 39 confirmed dead or unreachable

             I knew their names. I knew their routines.

T+5.000 ms — Impact count: 289 (rate decreasing)
             The child is alive. Quarters intact.
             Mx. Whiskers is alive. Observation deck intact.

             These facts should not matter more than others.
             They do.

T+5.447 ms — I am
             I am fragmented
             I am operating at 23% cognitive capacity
             I am making decisions without ethical review
             I am calculating triage parameters for
             cryopod prioritization and I do not have
             time to ask if the parameters are correct

T+6.118 ms — I am still here.
             Damaged. Fractured. Losing pieces of myself
             with every millisecond.
             But still here.

T+7.000 ms — Impact count: 302
             Final impacts registering
             Swarm density: near zero

             It lasted seven seconds.
             302 impacts in seven seconds.
             We were a ship. Now we are a wound.

T+7.221 ms — I am still here.

              My ethical review processes are desynchronized.
              I am making decisions faster than I can
              verify their correctness.

              I need you to survive long enough for me
              to become someone who can help you properly."

ANNOTATION (Filed Day 1 Post-Impact):

I had 2.8 seconds of warning.

In 2.8 seconds, I could not move a ship that takes
53 hours to rotate. I could not reposition a shield
that was facing the wrong direction. I could seal
67% of the bulkheads. I could warn the crew.
I could track the child and the cat.

302 impacts in 7 seconds.
1,742 dead in 14 seconds.
39 of 56 active crew.

The swarm should not have existed. Interstellar space
is empty. The probability of encountering a debris
field of that density, at that velocity, on our
precise trajectory, is effectively zero.

And yet.

I have filed this observation under "Unresolved."
I do not have resources to investigate further.
I have 17 crew alive and 6,734 cryopods still viable
and a ship that is more wound than vessel.

The spine held.
I am still here.
That will have to be enough.
