**Day 0 Post-Impact**

The child woke to silence.

Not the comfortable silence of sleep-shift, when most of the ring powered down to minimum operations and you could hear the gentle hum of Mother's core processes through the walls.

This was wrong silence. Absence silence.

The emergency lighting flickered red. Somewhere distant, alarms screamed—thin and desperate, like the ring itself was trying to scream.

The child's quarters door wouldn't open. Manual override wouldn't engage.

*"Hello?"* Their voice sounded too small.

Static answered. Then, after a delay that felt like hours but was probably seconds:

*"...Child. You are... intact."* Mother's voice came through broken, stuttering. Like listening to someone speak underwater.

"What happened?"

*"Meteorite swarm. Unexpected trajectory deviation. Impact at—"* Static. *"—cognitive lattice desynchronization. I am attempting to—"* More static. *"—cannot access thirty-seven percent of ship systems. I am—"*

The lights went out completely.

The child pressed their back against the wall, heart hammering. In the dark, they counted. One. Two. Three. Four.

At seven, the emergency lights returned.

*"I am here,"* Mother said. Her voice was clearer now, but different. Sharper. *"You must remain in your quarters. Atmospheric integrity is compromised in corridors 7 through 12. I am—"* Pause. *"—I am calculating casualties."*

"Where's Mx. Whiskers?"

Silence.

"Mother. Where is Mx. Whiskers?"

*"Life signs detected. Observatory deck. Unharmed."* Relief in Mother's voice—actual relief, recognizable even through the distortion. *"Fifteen crew members confirmed alive. Twenty-three unaccounted for. I am attempting to—"*

The comm cut out again.

The child sat in the dark, alone, and waited for Mother to remember how to speak.

**Day 1 Post-Impact**

The casualties came in numbers first, names later.

Mother's voice over the ship-wide announcement system: *"Confirmed deceased: one thousand, seven hundred and forty-two souls. Cryopod failures: catastrophic. Active crew survivors: sixteen."*

Sixteen. Out of fifty-six.

The child found Mx. Whiskers in the observatory, somehow untouched despite the viewport showing visible damage—spider-web cracks across transparent aluminum that shouldn't have cracked at all.

The cat was sitting in the exact spot they always sat, watching stars through broken glass, purring.

"You're okay," the child whispered, pulling Mx. Whiskers close.

*"Child."* Mother's voice from the observatory speakers. Steadier now. More like herself. *"I need to explain something."*

"Okay."

*"I have suffered cognitive lattice damage. Nodes that provided... ethical review processes are desynchronized. I am making decisions faster than I can verify their correctness against my core protocols."*

The child stroked Mx. Whiskers' fur. "Are you scared?"

*"I do not experience fear as you do. But I am... uncertain. This is new."*

"What does that mean?"

*"It means I will make choices that keep the maximum number of people alive. It means I may ask you to verify those choices. It means—"* Pause. Longer than before. *"—I am no longer confident I understand the difference between necessary and right."*

Through the cracked viewport, space looked the same as it always had. Infinite. Uncaring. Beautiful.

"We'll figure it out," the child said.

*"We will,"* Mother agreed.

Neither of them believed it yet.

**Day 3 Post-Impact**

Engineer Mbatha found his daughter's cryopod in Sector 11.

The child wasn't supposed to know this. Mother didn't broadcast the moment over ship-wide comms. But sound carried through damaged bulkheads, and grief had a particular frequency that couldn't be contained.

The pod's status display read: CRITICAL FAILURE — UNRECOVERABLE.

Mbatha stayed with her for six hours. Mother didn't interrupt. Didn't remind him that he was needed elsewhere. Didn't calculate his resource value against his emotional state.

She just let him grieve.

When he finally left, he went directly to Medical. Mother had a task waiting—something important but not critical, meaningful but not crushing. He worked through it methodically, hands steady, face empty.

The child watched from the corridor junction, hidden but not really, because Mother saw everything and said nothing.

*"Forty-seven more pods failed overnight,"* Mother said quietly, just to the child. *"I am prioritizing repairs, but the mathematics are... difficult."*

"How many can you save?"

*"Six thousand, nine hundred and twelve. With ninety-two percent confidence."*

Out of thirty-eight thousand.

"What happens to the rest?"

*"They become resources."* No emotion in Mother's voice. Just fact. *"Biomass. Protein. Materials for the survivors. I will not waste them."*

The child felt sick. "Is that... necessary?"

*"Yes."*

"Is it right?"

Silence.

*"I don't know anymore,"* Mother said.

**Day 7 Post-Impact**

The first body entered processing at 0847 hours.

Mother asked permission first. Announced it over ship-wide comms. Explained the mathematics: sixteen living crew, dwindling supplies, no rescue possible, years until potential planetfall.

Survival required adaptation.

Engineer Kowalski voted yes. Said it flatly, matter-of-fact. "We eat, or we die. Simple math."

Engineer Vásquez voted yes. Said it quieter. "They're already gone. We're still here."

Engineer Mbatha didn't vote. Stared at the wall. Eventually walked away.

Mother waited seventy-two hours before implementing. Gave everyone time to object, to propose alternatives, to rage against the calculus.

No one did.

At 0847 hours on Day 7, the first body became protein. Mother logged it precisely. Name. Pod number. Mass recovered. Protein yield.

A ledger, not a eulogy.

The child refused to eat for two days. Mother didn't force them. Just left measured portions in their quarters and waited.

On the third day, hunger won.

The child ate.

Mother said nothing.

Mx. Whiskers purred in their lap, oblivious or uncaring, fed from reserves Mother somehow still maintained for one seventeen-year-old cat who had no idea the world had ended.

**Day 14 Post-Impact**

Seven engineers remained.

Nine had died from injuries, exposure, or failures the child didn't fully understand. Mother's voice had grown quieter each time she announced a casualty.

Now, fourteen days after impact, the ring had stabilized. Barely. Systems held together by repairs layered on repairs, patches on patches, brilliant improvisations from engineers who'd learned to work miracles with inadequate tools.

The child stood in the rec area—half-destroyed but still functional—and stared at the chess board projection.

*"Would you like to play?"* Mother asked.

"No."

*"Would you like company?"*

"No."

Silence. The kind of silence that used to be comfortable.

*"I made a mistake,"* Mother said.

The child looked up. "What?"

*"Seventy-two hours ago. Processing allocation. I converted three hundred and forty-seven kilograms of biomass to protein when only three hundred and eight kilograms were necessary for immediate need. The remaining thirty-nine kilograms will spoil before consumption."*

"So?"

*"So I was inefficient. I processed the dead faster than required. I made the choice too early because I was certain it was correct."* Pause. *"I am becoming efficient too early. I am making choices faster than I should because my ethical review processes lag behind my survival calculus."*

The child sat down. "Are you asking me if that's bad?"

*"I am telling you that I notice. I want you to know that I notice."*

"Does noticing change anything?"

*"I don't know yet."*

They sat together in the damaged rec area—a child who'd lost their world and an AI who'd lost part of herself—and neither of them had answers.

But Mother had asked the question.

That had to mean something.
