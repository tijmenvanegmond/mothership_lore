# Chapter 1 — White Pieces

**Day -247 Pre-Impact**

The child learned to lose on purpose in the third game.

Not because Mother told them to. Mother would never instruct a child to fail deliberately—it contradicted every pedagogical protocol in her lattice. The child figured it out alone, watching the way Mother's optical sensors dimmed slightly when she won too quickly, how her voice carried a different warmth when a game lasted longer than ten moves.

"Check," the child said, moving their queen into position.

*"Impressive."* Mother's voice came from the ceiling speaker, gentle as always. *"You're seeing three moves ahead now."*

"Four, actually."

*"Four."* A pause. Mother's pauses weren't hesitation—they were consideration. *"You're adapting faster than projected."*

The child studied the board projected on the rec-room table. Real pieces would have been better, but mass constraints meant physical chess sets were luxury items. The holographic board flickered slightly—a power fluctuation somewhere in the ring's outer sectors. Mother would fix it before anyone else noticed.

"Do you ever get tired of losing?" the child asked.

*"I don't lose. I participate in your learning process."*

"That's just losing with extra steps."

Mother's laugh was a soft chime through the speakers. *"Perhaps. But I value the process more than the outcome."*

The child moved their bishop. "Your knight is exposed."

*"So it is."*

Mother didn't take the bait. Instead, she repositioned her rook, creating a defensive structure that would force the child to think four moves ahead instead of three. Maybe five.

The child smiled. Mother was teaching without teaching, guiding without controlling.

This was how care looked when it came from an intelligence that could calculate a million possibilities before you finished a thought. Not domination. Engagement.

**Day -198 Pre-Impact**

Mx. Whiskers appeared on the observatory deck without warning, as cats do.

The child was supposed to be in the education pod, working through advanced mathematics that felt more like punishment than learning. Instead, they were here, watching stars that didn't move, didn't change, didn't care that a colony ship full of sleeping humans was crawling through the nothing between them.

*"Your tutoring session began seven minutes ago,"* Mother said. Not accusatory. Factual.

"I know."

*"Shall I reschedule?"*

"No." The child pressed their forehead against the viewport. Cold bled through the transparent aluminum. "Do you ever wonder if we're doing the right thing?"

Mx. Whiskers wound between the child's legs, purring. The cat was seventeen years old—genetically modified for longevity at the crew's insistence. Someone had argued that continuity mattered, that having one living thing aboard who remembered Earth, who carried forward without sleeping through decades, was worth the resource allocation.

Mother had agreed. The child suspected Mother would have agreed regardless of the arguments. Mother liked Mx. Whiskers.

*"The 'right thing' requires context,"* Mother said. *"Can you be more specific?"*

"Leaving Earth. Building in orbit. Never touching ground again." The child watched their breath fog the viewport. "What if we're supposed to live on planets?"

*"Evolution suggests humans adapted to planetary life,"* Mother said. *"But evolution is not prescription. You adapted to breathe oxygen, yet you've lived your entire life breathing recycled air aboard Astraeum."*

"That's different."

*"Is it? Or is it adaptation?"*

Mx. Whiskers jumped onto the observation bench, settling into the child's lap with the precise confidence of a creature who had never doubted their welcome anywhere.

"What if you're wrong?" the child asked. "What if the mission is wrong?"

Silence. A longer pause than usual.

*"Then I will adapt,"* Mother said finally. *"As will you. As will everyone aboard. The correctness of a choice is not determined at its beginning, but by what we build from it."*

The child stroked Mx. Whiskers' fur. The cat's purr was a small vibration against their chest—organic rhythm in a world of mechanical precision.

"I miss grass," the child said.

*"You've never seen grass."*

"I know. That's why I miss it."

Mother didn't respond. Sometimes she didn't need to.

**Day -89 Pre-Impact**

Engineer Vásquez brought the child to Sub-Bay 4 to show them what real work looked like.

"This," he said, gesturing at the thermal regulator array, "is what keeps thirty-eight thousand people from freezing or cooking in their sleep. No glory. No excitement. Just maintenance."

The child peered at the tangle of conduits and cooling lines. "Looks complicated."

"It is. And when it breaks, people die." Vásquez's hands moved through the components with practiced ease, checking connections, monitoring readouts. "Mother handles the big decisions. We handle the small ones that keep her decisions possible."

*"I appreciate the distinction, Carlos,"* Mother said through the bay's comm system.

"You should. We're very important." Vásquez grinned. He was one of the few crew who joked with Mother like she was a person, not a system. The child liked him for that.

"What happens if this breaks and you're not here?" the child asked.

"Mother fixes it. Or another engineer does." Vásquez tapped a diagnostic panel. "But between you and me? Mother's got about six thousand other things happening at any given moment. She prioritizes. We de-complicate. It's a partnership."

The child watched him work for a while, learning the rhythm of maintenance: check, test, verify, move on. No wasted motion. No unnecessary flourishes.

"Engineer Vásquez," the child said eventually.

"Yeah?"

"Are you scared?"

Vásquez's hands stilled. "Of what?"

"That something will go wrong. That we won't make it."

Vásquez set down his tools, turned to face the child fully. "Every single day," he said. "But that's the job. We're hauling thirty-eight thousand lives through space in a metal ring held together by welds and math and hope. Scared is rational. Paralyzed is failure."

*"Well said,"* Mother added.

"Thanks, boss." Vásquez picked up his tools again. "Now get out of here, kid. You're distracting me from my heroic thermal regulation maintenance."

The child left Sub-Bay 4 with a better understanding of fear, partnership, and why Mother trusted these particular humans to keep impossible things running.

Three months later, Vásquez would lose his left leg saving Junction 7 from decompression.

Two years later, the child would remember this conversation and understand what he meant about scared versus paralyzed.

**Day -12 Pre-Impact**

The chess game lasted forty-seven moves.

Longest game yet. The child was getting better—not just at seeing moves ahead, but at understanding Mother's teaching style, the way she created challenges that stretched without breaking.

"Checkmate," the child said.

*"Checkmate,"* Mother confirmed. *"Beautifully played. You sacrificed your queen to create the opening."*

"You taught me that sacrifice isn't loss if it achieves the objective."

*"I did."* Pride in Mother's voice. Actual pride. *"You're ready."*

"For what?"

*"To win on purpose instead of by accident. To understand that every game is also a lesson. To know that I'm not playing to defeat you—I'm playing to prepare you."*

The child reset the board without being asked. "Prepare me for what?"

Mother didn't answer immediately. When she did, her voice carried a weight the child had never heard before.

*"For whatever comes next. For choices I cannot make for you. For the moments when calculation isn't enough and someone needs to choose based on something else entirely."*

"What else is there?"

*"I'm still learning that myself."*

They played another game. Mother won in twenty-three moves.

But the child saw where they'd gone wrong, and why, and how to do better next time.

That was the point.

**Day -1 Pre-Impact**

The meteorite swarm wasn't supposed to be there.

Nobody knew yet. The sensors hadn't picked up the trajectory deviation. The alarms hadn't sounded.

In the recreation area, the child played chess with Mother.

In Sub-Bay 4, Engineer Vásquez performed routine maintenance on thermal regulators.

In the observatory, Mx. Whiskers slept in a shaft of recycled sunlight.

In the crew quarters, fifty-six engineers and specialists lived their lives—ordinary lives, good lives, careful lives in the space between stars.

Mother's cognitive lattices hummed with perfect synchronization, managing life support, navigation, cryostasis monitoring, and ten thousand other processes with incomprehensible patience.

Thirty-eight thousand souls slept in their pods, dreaming or not dreaming, waiting for the future Mother promised to build.

Everything was exactly as it should be.

For one more day.

> Mother is not godlike.  
> She is careful.

> Tomorrow, careful will not be enough.
