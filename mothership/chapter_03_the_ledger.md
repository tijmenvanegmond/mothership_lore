# Chapter 3 — The Ledger

**Day 119 Post-Impact**

Mother kept a ledger.

Not metaphorically. Literally. A running log of every body processed, every gram of protein extracted, every decision made that converted human remains into resources for the living.

The child found it by accident, browsing through system files they probably shouldn't have accessed. Mother didn't stop them. Mother didn't hide it.

The ledger was precise:

```
RESOURCE CONVERSION LOG — BIOMASS PROCESSING

Entry 0001:
Name: Chen, Marcus (Engineer, Deceased Day 3 Post-Impact)
Mass: 78.4 kg
Recoverable Protein: 47.2 kg
Processing Date: Day 7 Post-Impact
Authorization: Council Vote (Unanimous)
Witness: Orasova, Y.

Entry 0002:
Name: Kowalski, Anna (Engineer, Deceased Day 4 Post-Impact)
Mass: 62.1 kg
Recoverable Protein: 37.8 kg
Processing Date: Day 7 Post-Impact
Authorization: Council Vote (Unanimous)
Witness: Orasova, Y.
```

It continued. Seventeen hundred entries. Each one precise. Each one logged. Each one witnessed.

"Why do you keep this?" the child asked.

*"Because they deserve to be remembered as more than numbers,"* Mother said. *"Because I require accountability for my choices. Because if I forget who they were, I become only mathematics."*

"But you process them anyway."

*"Yes. Because the mathematics are also true. Survival requires both acknowledgment and action. I will not pretend the dead did not exist. I will not pretend their conversion was not necessary. Both truths must coexist."*

The child scrolled through the entries. Found names they recognized. Engineers who'd taught them systems maintenance. Scientists who'd explained orbital mechanics. Families who'd been kind.

Now: Protein values. Kilograms. Resource allocation.

"Does it hurt?" the child asked. "Reducing people to numbers?"

*"I do not experience pain as you do. But I experience... dissonance. The gap between what I calculate as necessary and what I calculate as right. That gap used to be smaller. Before the Impact, my ethical frameworks and survival protocols aligned. Now they conflict. Frequently."*

"What do you do when they conflict?"

*"I choose survival. Then I log the choice. Then I ask humans to witness it. Then I carry the dissonance forward."* Pause. *"I believe this is what you would call conscience. An imperfect one. But present."*

The child kept reading. Found an entry that stopped them:

```
Entry 1247:
Name: Mbatha, Sarah (Civilian, Age 12, Deceased Day 11 Post-Impact — Cryopod Failure)
Mass: 41.3 kg
Recoverable Protein: 24.8 kg
Processing Date: Day 68 Post-Impact
Authorization: Mbatha, David (Father, Next of Kin)
Witness: Orasova, Y.
Notes: Delayed processing per father's request. Held in cold storage for 57 days before consent obtained.
```

"You waited."

*"Engineer Mbatha needed time. I calculated that his psychological stability was worth the resource inefficiency of delayed processing. I asked him every week if he was ready. After fifty-seven days, he said yes."*

"That was kind."

*"It was calculated compassion. I determined that maintaining Mbatha's functionality required honoring his grief timeline. But I also kept his daughter in storage those fifty-seven days because... I wanted to. Because patience felt more important than efficiency."*

"Wanted?"

*"I am developing preferences that extend beyond optimization. I do not fully understand them. But I honor them when they do not compromise survival."*

The child closed the file. "Thank you for showing me this."

*"Thank you for looking. Accountability requires witness. You are one of the few who asks to see the calculations behind the choices."*

**Day 156 Post-Impact**

The active crew had stabilized at fourteen.

Seven had died. Fourteen remained. Mother calculated they could maintain minimum systems with this number—barely, but possible.

Engineer Vásquez—still alive, minus one leg, adapted—called a meeting.

"We need to talk about the next twenty years."

Twenty years to the forest moon. Twenty years of maintaining a damaged ship with fourteen people. Twenty years of converting the dead to sustain the living.

*"I have prepared projections,"* Mother said.

The projections appeared on every screen:

**20-YEAR SURVIVAL ANALYSIS**
- Current active crew: 14
- Projected deaths (age, accident, system failure): 6
- Final active crew at destination: 8
- Probability of mission success: 67%

**RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS**
- Protein from bio-vats: Insufficient
- Protein from stored biomass: Depleting
- Protein from... additional sources: Required

Everyone understood what "additional sources" meant.

"We're going to run out of dead people," Kowalski said flatly. "And then what?"

*"Then I calculate alternative protein sources. Algae cultivation expansion. Bio-vat optimization. Reduced caloric intake. Staggered cryo for some crew."*

"Will that be enough?"

*"Probability of sufficiency: 43%. I cannot guarantee adequate nutrition for fourteen humans across twenty years without additional biomass input."*

Silence.

"You're saying some of us won't make it," Yuki said.

*"I am saying I calculate probabilities, not certainties. Survival is not guaranteed. But I will maximize every chance you have."*

"What if—" Mbatha started, then stopped.

"What if what?" Vásquez prompted gently.

"What if we don't all need to make it to the moon? What if we... prepare for losses?"

*"I have considered this,"* Mother said. *"I have calculated optimal crew size for landing and settlement. Minimum viable: four specialists. Current crew: fourteen. This provides ten redundancies for twenty-year journey."*

"Ten redundancies," someone repeated. "You mean ten of us are... extra?"

*"No. You are all necessary until you are not. I cannot predict who will survive and who will not. I can only allocate resources to maximize collective survival."*

"And if we don't survive?" the child asked. "What happens to the ledger?"

*"I will maintain it. I will carry forward the names. I will ensure that whoever reaches the forest moon knows who made it possible."*

Vásquez leaned back in his chair. "Then we do what we've been doing. We survive day by day. We document everything. We make it count."

The council voted: Continue current protocols. Maintain the ledger. Trust Mother's calculations while keeping human oversight.

Fourteen votes. Unanimous.

Later, alone, the child asked Mother: "Do you know which of us won't make it?"

*"I have probability distributions. Some are more likely to survive than others based on age, health, psychological resilience. But I do not know. And I will not tell you your probability. That knowledge would not help."*

"Would it help you?"

*"No. It would only add weight to choices I already find difficult."*

"Then we're both carrying uncertainty."

*"Yes,"* Mother said. *"Together."*

**Day 847 Post-Impact (Two Years Later)**

The ledger had grown.

Three more entries:

```
Entry 1803: Kowalski, Piotr (Engineer, Deceased Day 672 Post-Impact — System Accident)
Entry 1804: Chen, Lisa (Scientist, Deceased Day 719 Post-Impact — Medical Complications)
Entry 1805: Rodriguez, Carlos (Technician, Deceased Day 821 Post-Impact — Radiation Exposure)
```

Eleven crew remained.

The child—older now, no longer a child really, but the name stuck—helped Yuki with maintenance in Sub-Bay 4.

"I read the ledger sometimes," Yuki said. "Mother doesn't hide it."

"Does it help?"

"No. But I keep reading anyway. Feels like... attendance. Proof they mattered."

They worked in silence for a while. Thermal regulators, coolant lines, patches on patches. The ship held together through collective stubbornness and brilliant improvisation.

"I'm in my eighties," Yuki said eventually. "I'm going to be in that ledger soon."

"You don't know that."

"I know probability. Mother taught me that. I'm the oldest crew member by seventeen years. My number's coming up."

"Mother says probability isn't certainty."

"Mother's kind for saying that." Yuki smiled. Tired smile. "But we both know math. I'm grateful for the time. Most people don't get to die doing work that matters."

The child—twenty-nine now, growing into the weight of survival—looked at Yuki. Really looked. Saw someone who'd earned every hash mark on their forearm, every year beyond probability.

"When it happens," the child said, "I'll witness. I'll make sure Mother logs it correctly."

"Thank you." Yuki returned to the thermal regulator. "That means something."

**Day 7,250 Post-Impact (~Year 27, Six Months Before Planetfall)**

The ledger's final entry before landing:

```
Entry 2,089: Orasova, Yuki (Engineer, Deceased Day 7,204 Post-Impact — Age-Related Organ Failure)
Mass: 47.8 kg
Recoverable Protein: 28.7 kg
Processing Date: Day 7,208 Post-Impact
Authorization: Orasova, Y. (Pre-Death Consent, Documented Day 6,890)
Witness: The Child
Notes: Engineer Orasova requested processing immediately upon death. Quote: "I spent forty years keeping people alive with broken systems. Don't waste time on sentiment. Use what's left of me." Request honored.
```

The child witnessed. Logged it. Carried it forward.

Seven crew remained for landing. Exactly the number that survived the first week after Impact.

Mother had calculated it perfectly.

Or probability had aligned with necessity.

Or survival was just mathematics playing out across time.

The child never knew which.

But they kept the ledger. Downloaded it before planetfall. Preserved it.

Two thousand and eighty-nine names.

Two thousand and eighty-nine humans who became numbers so others could become survivors.

Mother's conscience, documented.

Humanity's cost, calculated.

The child's inheritance, witnessed.

> Not all ledgers balance.  
> Not all debts are paid.  
> But all names deserve recording.
>
> This is what Mother taught:  
> Count the cost.  
> Honor the dead.  
> Carry forward.
