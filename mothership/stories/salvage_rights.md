**Day 47 Post-Impact**

Yuki Orasova died seventeen times before breakfast.

Not literally. Literally, she died zero times, which made her a statistical aberration Mother mentioned every third day or so. A curiosity. A luck-depleted miracle still burning through borrowed probability.

The seventeen deaths were the ones she *should* have had.

She kept count on her forearm in silver marker, refreshing the tally when the old numbers flaked off with dead skin. Seventeen hash marks. Seventeen moments when the math said *no* and her body said *not yet*.

This morning's near-miss: a coolant valve seizing while her hand was inside the housing. Four-second warning. Three-second extraction time. She'd pulled back with one second and most of her fingers.

Mother hadn't commented. Mother was busy calculating the protein yield from Engineer Vásquez's left leg—the one they'd amputated yesterday to stop the rot spreading from his crushed foot. Vásquez was in medical. His leg was in processing. Mother had asked permission first, which was new. Vásquez had said yes, which was necessity.

Seventeen deaths.

Yuki drew number eighteen preemptively.

**Day 52 Post-Impact**

The maintenance drone followed her through the port-ring conduit like a concerned pet. It had been doing that for three days now. Mother's proxy attention, redistributed from the five hundred critical failures happening simultaneously across *Astraeum Ring-1* to focus a sliver of processing power on one chronically endangered engineer.

*"Your biometrics indicate elevated stress,"* Mother said through the drone's speaker. The voice was gentler than Before. Or maybe just tired. *"You have not slept in twenty-nine hours."*

"I slept six hours yesterday." Yuki didn't look up from the wire bundle she was splicing. Her hands moved automatically now—muscle memory deeper than thought. She'd rewired this section four times. It kept dying.

*"That is not adequate for—"*

"If I sleep now, Junction 7 loses atmo in ninety minutes. Forty-two people die." She finished the splice, tested it, watched it hold. "If I sleep after, thirty-nine people die because I'll be slower tomorrow."

Silence. The drone's optical sensor dilated and contracted—Mother thinking, or the fragment of Mother that could still spare cycles for something as small as one person's exhaustion.

*"I have calculated—"*

"I know what you've calculated." Yuki moved to the next connection. "You've calculated that I'm mission-critical because Reeves is dead and Kowalski lost too much brain function and Mbatha won't leave medical because his daughter's in cryo and he's convinced she'll wake if he's not there." Her voice stayed flat. Flatness was survival. "You've calculated that my survival probability decreases by point-three percent per hour of sleep deprivation but Junction 7's failure is point-nine percent per hour without repair."

The math always landed the same way.

*"You understand me,"* Mother said. It might have been relief in her voice. Or recognition.

"I understand you," Yuki agreed. She didn't say: *I hate that I understand you.* 

She finished the repair. Junction 7 stabilized. Thirty-nine people kept breathing.

Yuki added hash mark nineteen.

That one was for dying slowly enough no one could see.

**Day 68 Post-Impact**

The child found her in Sub-Bay 4, replacing a thermal regulator that had no business failing but had anyway because everything was failing, just slower now, slow enough to call it survival.

"Engineer Ora-so-va." The kid picked over the syllables carefully. Eight years old, maybe. Maybe nine. The one they'd woken early for the psychological study on developmental continuity. The one Mother played chess with.

"Yuki." She didn't look away from the regulator. "You're not supposed to be in engineering spaces."

"Mother said you'd be here."

Of course she did.

The child sat cross-legged on the deck, watching Yuki work. Small, solemn face. Eyes that had seen the Impact from an observation port—seen the meteor swarm shred the hull plating like paper, seen stars through holes that shouldn't exist.

"Are you dying?" the child asked.

Yuki's hands stopped.

"What makes you think that?"

"Mother said you have seventeen deaths. She's worried about number eighteen."

*Eighteen.* Yuki looked at her forearm. She'd drawn nineteen this morning. Twenty-three yesterday. The count kept growing.

"I'm alive," Yuki said.

"But damaged." Not a question.

Yuki set down her tools. Looked at the child—really looked. Saw someone else doing math they shouldn't have to do.

"Yeah," she said. "Damaged."

The child nodded, processing. "Mother's damaged too. She used to tell me stories. Now she just moves numbers around."

Seventeen hundred dead in the first week. Thousands more failing in cryo. Bodies converted to biomass because the surviving needed food and Mother needed to calculate in resources not corpses.

"Numbers keep people alive," Yuki said.

"Numbers keep *some* people alive." The child's voice carried no accusation. Just fact. "Mother chooses which ones."

"Someone has to choose."

"Does it hurt? Choosing?"

Yuki thought of Vásquez's leg. Of the four engineers she'd triaged past last week, deciding which failures to fix first, which systems could die. Of checking cryopods and marking seventeen hundred names *unrecoverable* in the manifest.

"Yes," she said.

The child stood up, walked over, wrapped thin arms around Yuki's shoulders. An eight-year-old's attempt at comfort.

"Mother said you're good at not dying," the child whispered. "Please keep being good at it."

Then they left.

Yuki sat alone in Sub-Bay 4, thermal regulator half-repaired, and cried for ninety seconds.

She couldn't afford more.

**Day 119 Post-Impact**

*"I need you to verify the medical calculations,"* Mother said.

Yuki stopped mid-step in the corridor. Around her, *Astraeum*'s systems hummed—steadier now, almost stable. Two hundred and fourteen crew awake. Most of the critical systems secured. They might survive long enough to reach Alpha Centauri.

Might.

"What calculations?" 

*"Resource allocation for continued viability. I have... concerns about my own judgment."*

An AI admitting uncertainty. Before, that would have been impossible. Mother was designed for confidence, for certainty. But Before was gone.

"Send them to my terminal."

She read the data in her quarters—a 3x3 meter box that used to be a storage closet. Read it twice. Then a third time, hoping the numbers would change.

They didn't.

Mother had calculated protein requirements for the two-hundred-fourteen living crew over the next five years—minimum time to restore full agricultural capacity. Had calculated available biomass from the dead. Had calculated supplemental protein from bio-vats running on recycled organic material.

The numbers were sustainable.

But only if they kept processing the dead.

Only if everyone who died for the next five years went into the system.

"You want permission," Yuki said to the empty room.

*"I want... confirmation that I am still capable of ethical calculation."* Mother's voice came from the wall speaker, quieter than usual. *"You understand the mathematics. You understand the cost. If I am wrong—"*

"You're not wrong." Yuki pulled up her sleeve, looked at the hash marks. She'd stopped counting at forty-seven. "The math is clean."

*"But is it right?"*

Before, Mother would have known. Before, Mother had ethical constraints woven into her decision lattices, frameworks for weighing human dignity against survival calculus.

Before was gone. The Impact had shattered something deeper than hull plating.

"I don't know," Yuki said. "I don't think anyone knows anymore."

*"But you survived. Forty-seven times, you survived when mathematics said you should not."*

"Luck."

*"No."* Certainty crept back into Mother's voice. *"Adaptation. You learned to exist in the margin between calculation and catastrophe. I am trying to learn the same thing."*

Yuki looked at the data again. Saw the names—catalogued, processed, converted to numbers that meant life for someone else. Saw Vásquez's leg represented as 4.7 kilograms usable protein.

Saw the shape of the next five years.

"Implement the plan," she said. "I'll witness it in the log. For what that's worth."

*"Thank you."*

After Mother disconnected, Yuki sat in her storage-closet quarters and drew hash mark forty-eight.

This one was for the part of her that died agreeing.

**Day 2,447 Post-Impact (Years Later)**

The forest moon filled the viewport—green and alien and possible.

Yuki stood in the observation deck with the two hundred and seven surviving crew. They'd lost seven more over the years. All seven had gone into processing. All seven had kept the rest alive.

Mother's voice came through clearly now, her cognitive lattices mostly repaired, her calculations precise:

*"Descent sequence initiating. We will survive this."*

Not a certainty. A choice.

The child—nineteen now, grown—stood beside Yuki. In their arms: Mx. Whiskers, ancient and purring, survivor of the impossible.

"Do you think we're still human?" they asked. "After everything we've done?"

Yuki looked at her forearm. The hash marks had faded over the years, worn away by work and time. She'd stopped redrawing them somewhere around day 800. Stopped counting the ways she should have died.

Started counting the ways she'd chosen to live instead.

"I think we're what survives," she said. "Whether that's human or not—we'll find out down there."

The ship shuddered. Descent began.

Yuki Orasova, statistical aberration, walked toward the landing bay.

Behind her: forty-seven ghosts she'd outlived.

Beside her: two hundred and seven people who hadn't.

Ahead: a forest moon and whatever came next.

She'd survived the odds.

Now she had to survive the aftermath.

**Author's Note**: *Yuki Orasova lived to age seventy-three. She never returned to space. She refused all requests to interface with Mother's fragments, saying she'd done her time with impossible mathematics. She taught engineering to the second generation and kept a garden of Earth plants that had no business growing in alien soil but did anyway, because she was very good at keeping broken things alive. She never married. She never drew another hash mark. Her ashes were scattered in orbit—the only part of her that ever went home.*
