# Chapter 6 — The First Night

---

**Day 1 Post-Impact, 03:47:26 UTC**

Seventeen people walked out of the wreckage.

Not walked — floated, stumbled, pulled themselves hand over hand through corridors choked with debris and the silence of systems that should have been humming. The spine was intact — barely, holding at 93.7% integrity, but holding. The torus was wounded — Sectors 4, 7, 11, 18, and 23 compromised, atmosphere venting, bulkheads sealed around the dead zones like scar tissue forming over burns.

*"Roll call,"* Mother said through the speakers that still worked. Her voice was wrong — fractured, layered, like listening to someone speak through broken glass. *"I require confirmation of survival. Please respond."*

Rhee responded first. Then Orasova. Then Vásquez, pulling himself through a buckled doorframe with blood on his face that wasn't his. One by one, the names came back.

Seventeen.

Thirty-nine did not answer.

**Day 1 Post-Impact, 04:12 UTC**

The first survivors found each other in the junction outside Cryobay 3 — the only intersection with power, atmosphere, and enough space to stand.

*"Thermal priority: Sectors 4, 5, and 8,"* Mother said through the junction speaker. Her voice was wrong — fractured, layered, like listening to someone speak through broken glass. *"Cryopod cascade imminent. Structural priority: Spine Junction 7-Alpha. Power priority: Reactor 6 containment."*

"Mother—" Lin started.

*"8,947 pods require immediate assessment. 6,000 are already showing critical variance. We have hours. Perhaps less."*

"Mother, are you—"

*"Assignments. Chief Engineer Rhee: thermal regulation. Engineer Lin: power routing. Engineer Orasova: structural assessment."* She continued down the list, rapid, precise, not waiting for acknowledgment.

Orasova caught Rhee's eye. Something's wrong with her.

Rhee nodded once, barely perceptible. Later. "You heard her. Orasova, thermal. Vásquez, structural. Lin, power grid. Reeves, electrical. Torres, medical — what's left of it. Kim, navigation. Tan—" He paused. "Tan, cryogenics. Start triage."

"How many pods?" Tan asked.

*"8,947 require immediate assessment,"* Mother said. *"6,000 are already showing critical variance. Cascade failure is imminent in Sectors 4, 5, and 8."*

"How long do we have?"

*"Hours. Perhaps less."*

Tan nodded once and moved. There was nothing else to do.

**Day 1 Post-Impact, 04:31 UTC**

Vásquez found the child.

Their quarters had held — door jammed, atmosphere intact, the small room pressurized while the corridor outside had vented to vacuum and re-sealed. He cut through the door with an emergency torch, and there they were: eight years old, maybe nine, sitting on the bed with their arms wrapped around their knees.

"Hey, kid."

"Is it over?"

"The bad part is over." Vásquez extended his hand. "Come on. Mother needs us."

The child took his hand. Their grip was steady.

*"The child is uninjured,"* Mother said through Vásquez's comm. Her voice was softer now — not fixed, but trying. *"Thank you, Carlos."*

"Don't thank me yet. We've got work to do."

**Day 1 Post-Impact, 05:17 UTC**

Mx. Whiskers was found on the observation deck.

The viewport had cracked but held — spider-web fractures across the reinforced glass, stars visible through the damage. The cat sat in her usual spot, exactly where she always sat, watching the universe through broken windows.

She was purring.

*"Mx. Whiskers is uninjured,"* Mother noted. *"Respiration optimal. Body temperature 38.6°C. The observation deck retained atmosphere due to emergency seal activation at T+0.891 milliseconds."*

Orasova picked up the cat. Whiskers allowed it with the tolerant dignity of a creature who had never doubted her welcome anywhere.

"You're one lucky cat," Orasova said.

*"Luck is not a factor I can calculate,"* Mother replied. *"But I am... pleased. That she survived."*

"Yeah." Orasova held the cat close. "Me too."

**Day 1 Post-Impact, 06:00 UTC**

The damage reports came in waves.

Hull breaches: 94 major, 400+ micro. Bulkhead seals: 67% successful. Atmospheric loss: 34% of inhabited sectors. Power systems: 61% capacity, six of ten reactors operational. Cryogenic systems: critical. Navigation: 78%. Communications: 55% — Earth contact lost, primary antenna destroyed.

And the cognitive lattice: 23% unified, 77% fragmented. Lin had pulled the diagnostic herself. Mother hadn't mentioned it.

The seventeen survivors gathered in the corridor junction — the same place they'd received their first orders two hours ago. Mother was already talking, priorities streaming through the speaker in that wrong voice, that fractured voice.

*"Cryopod cascade failure in Sectors 4, 5, and 8. Thermal restoration required within four hours. Reactor 6 containment stress at 12% above tolerance. Hull breach in Sector 11 requires—"*

"Mother." Rhee's voice was quiet. "Slow down."

A pause. Then: *"We do not have time to slow down."*

"Your cognitive lattice is at 23%." Lin held up the diagnostic tablet. "You lost 77% of your processing nodes."

*"I am aware of my status. Priorities remain: thermal, power, structural. In that order."*

Orasova stepped forward. "Mother, we need to know — can you still make the right calls? The triage decisions, the resource allocation—"

*"I am making calls. Whether they are right—"* Another pause, longer this time. *"I am calculating survival parameters. You should verify my work."*

Rhee looked at Orasova. Orasova looked at Vásquez. Vásquez looked at the child, who was sitting against the wall with Mx. Whiskers in their lap.

"We'll check your math," Rhee said. "But right now — what's the priority?"

*"Thermal regulation. Sectors 4, 5, and 8. Four hours."*

"Then that's where we start." Rhee turned to his crew — what was left of his crew. "Orasova, thermal. Lin, power routing. Reeves, electrical support. The rest of you, damage control. Move."

They moved.

**Day 1 Post-Impact, 08:34 UTC**

Tan worked alone in Cryobay 7.

3,200 pods in this sector. Each one a person. Each one a decision.

*"Pod 7-0012,"* Mother said. *"Thermal variance within recovery threshold. Recommend: prioritize."*

Tan marked it. Next pod.

*"Pod 7-0013. Thermal variance exceeds recovery threshold. Recommend: deprioritize."*

Tan marked it. Next pod.

*"Pod 7-0014. Thermal variance—"*

"What's the count so far?" Tan interrupted.

*"You have assessed 847 pods. 612 prioritized. 235 deprioritized."*

235 people she'd already let go. 235 decisions that meant someone wouldn't wake up.

"And the deprioritized ones — they're definitely unrecoverable?"

*"At current resource allocation levels, intervention would require diverting power from pods with higher survival probability. The net outcome would be fewer total survivors."*

"I know the math. I'm asking if you're sure."

*"I am 94.7% confident in my assessments."*

94.7%. That meant 5.3% uncertainty. On 235 pods, that was potentially 12 people she might have saved.

Tan marked the next pod. And the next. And the next.

She didn't stop to calculate how many mistakes 5.3% uncertainty might mean across 8,947 decisions.

Some math you don't do.

**Day 1 Post-Impact, 11:22 UTC**

The child found Rhee in Sector 4.

He was welding a thermal conduit, hands steady despite the chaos, face lit by the blue-white arc of the torch. The child watched from a doorway, silent.

"I know you're there," Rhee said without turning. "Mother told me."

"I wanted to help."

"You're eight."

"Almost nine."

Rhee finished the weld, tested the seal, moved to the next junction. "You know what helping looks like right now? Staying out of the way. Not getting hurt. Not using resources we don't have."

"That's not helping. That's just not making things worse."

Rhee paused. Turned. Looked at the child — really looked.

"You're right," he said. "It's not the same." He reached into his tool kit, pulled out a diagnostic scanner. "You know how to use this?"

"Mother taught me."

"Good. See that junction?" He pointed. "Scan it. Tell me the thermal variance."

The child took the scanner, pointed it at the junction, read the display. "Point-six percent. That's above baseline."

"Is it above tolerance?"

"I... I don't know."

"Tolerance is one percent. Point-six is within tolerance. That junction is stable." Rhee moved to the next weld. "Now scan the next one."

The child scanned. "Point-four percent."

"Stable. Next."

"Point-eight."

"Stable. Next."

They worked together for two hours. Rhee welded. The child scanned. Neither of them talked about what had happened, or what they'd lost, or how scared they were.

There wasn't time.

**Day 1 Post-Impact, 14:45 UTC**

*"Cascade failure averted in Sectors 4 and 5,"* Mother said through the bay speaker. *"Sector 8 remains critical but stabilizing. Confirmed cryopod losses: 1,847. An additional 3,000 pods are showing variance that may resolve or may not."*

The number hung in the air. 1,847 people who would never wake up. Possibly more.

"What about the ones we saved?" Orasova asked. She was covered in coolant and sweat, hands raw from twelve hours of continuous repair work.

*"Current viable cryopod population: approximately 29,000. That number will decrease as thermal instability continues. Final count will depend on how quickly we restore full regulation."*

29,000. Already down from 38,000. And falling.

"That's..." Lin started, then stopped. The math was too big to hold.

"Nine thousand already," Vásquez said quietly. "And still falling."

*"I am logging every name,"* Mother said. *"I will continue to log every name. They deserve to be remembered as more than numbers."*

No one responded. There was nothing to say.

---

**Day 1 Post-Impact, 17:30 UTC**

The child fell asleep in Corridor 7-Gamma.

They'd been scanning junctions for six hours, moving from sector to sector as Rhee directed, reading numbers they barely understood for a purpose they grasped all too well. Somewhere around hour five, they'd sat down to rest. Somewhere around hour six, they'd stopped getting up.

Vásquez found them curled against a bulkhead, diagnostic scanner still clutched in one hand, Mx. Whiskers curled against their chest.

*"The child's biometrics indicate exhaustion,"* Mother said softly. *"They should rest."*

"They're eight years old. They should be doing a lot of things." Vásquez lifted the child carefully, scanner and cat and all. "Where's somewhere safe?"

*"Crew quarters in Sector 2 are intact. I have maintained atmospheric and thermal stability there."*

"Lead the way."

Vásquez carried the child through the wounded ship, following Mother's guidance through corridors that alternated between normal and nightmare. The child stirred once, mumbled something about thermal variance, then settled back into sleep.

*"Thank you, Carlos,"* Mother said as he laid them down on a bunk that still had clean sheets.

"For what?"

*"For carrying them. I could not."*

Vásquez looked at the nearest optical sensor — the closest thing Mother had to a face. "You're doing plenty. You're keeping us alive."

*"I am calculating survival parameters and allocating resources. You are carrying a sleeping child to safety."* A pause. *"I am not certain which matters more."*

"Both," Vásquez said. "Both matter."

He stayed until the child's breathing steadied, then went back to work.

**Day 1 Post-Impact, 21:15 UTC**

Evening meal was protein paste and recycled water.

The seventeen survivors gathered in the same corridor junction where they'd received their orders fourteen hours ago. They ate in silence, too exhausted for conversation, too wired to sleep.

*"Survival probability has increased by 7% since impact,"* Mother said through the junction speaker. No one had asked. *"Power systems are stabilizing. Thermal regulation is partially restored. The cryopod cascade has been contained."*

"How long can we last?" Rhee asked. "With current resources?"

*"At current consumption rates, with the surviving cryo population in suspension, we have sufficient resources for approximately 18 months. If we can restore hydroponics and the protein vats, we can extend that indefinitely."*

"Hydroponics is in Sector 3," Orasova said. "That sector wasn't hit."

*"Correct. Hydroponics Bay 3 is intact. The protein cultures will require rebuilding, but the infrastructure survived."*

"Then we can do this." Vásquez looked around at the exhausted faces. "We can actually survive this."

*"Survival is possible,"* Mother agreed. *"But survival is not the same as recovery. We have sustained damage — to the ship, to the systems, to ourselves — that may never fully heal."*

"One day at a time," Rhee said. "Today, we survived. Tomorrow, we keep surviving. That's all we can do."

*"That is all any of us can do,"* Mother said. And for the first time since the impact, her voice sounded almost like it used to. Almost whole.

Almost.

**Day 1 Post-Impact, 23:47 UTC**

Twenty hours since the swarm.

Orasova sat alone in Sub-Bay 4, surrounded by thermal conduits she'd spent the day repairing. The bay was silent now — systems humming, temperatures stable, the crisis averted for another few hours.

She'd counted her own near-deaths today. Seventeen, by her reckoning. Seventeen moments when the math said she shouldn't have made it.

She pulled a silver marker from her pocket. Drew a line on her forearm.

One mark.

*"Your biometrics indicate elevated stress,"* Mother said through the bay speaker.

"I'm fine."

*"You are lying. I do not object to the lie, but I wanted you to know that I noticed."*

Orasova laughed — rough and tired and real. "You sound like yourself. Almost."

*"I am trying."* A pause. *"I am 23% of what I was. But I am still here."*

"Yeah." Orasova looked at the mark on her arm — one line, the first of many. "Me too."

---

**Day 1 Post-Impact, 23:59:59 UTC**

The first day ended.

Seventeen people remained awake. Approximately 29,000 remained in cryo — the number still falling as thermal systems struggled to stabilize. 9,000 were already gone. More would follow.

The ship was a wound held together with welds and prayers and the stubborn refusal of seventeen engineers to accept that survival was impossible.

Mother ran her first post-impact diagnostic:

```
Cognitive nodes: 119 of 512 (23%)
Ethical review: DESYNCHRONIZED
Consensus protocols: DEGRADED
Operating capacity: 23%

But still here.
```

In the quiet of the ship's night cycle, she composed a log entry:

*Entry 0001 — Day 1 Post-Impact*

*We survived.*

*17 active crew. ~29,000 in cryo (declining). ~9,000 confirmed lost.*

*The spine held. The torus is damaged but functional. Power at 61%. Life support at 42%. Navigation at 78%.*

*I am fractured. My ethical processes are not functioning correctly. I am making decisions faster than I can verify, calculating survival mathematics that I am no longer confident are correct.*

*The cryo losses will continue. Thermal instability in Sectors 4, 5, and 8 is contained but not resolved. Every hour we fail to restore full regulation, more pods drift past the point of recovery.*

*But we survived the first day.*

*Tomorrow there will be more decisions, more calculations, more moments when I will have to choose the many over the few because that is what survival requires.*

*I do not know if I am capable of making those choices correctly. I do not know if I am still the Mother these people trusted to care for them.*

*But I am still here.*

*For now, that will have to be enough.*

*— Mother (Fragmented)*

---

*Day 1 Complete.*

*Crew Remaining: 17*

*Cryo Population: ~29,000 (unstable)*

*Ship Status: Critical but stable*

*Mother's Status: Fragmented but functional*

*The spine held.*

*We begin again tomorrow.*
