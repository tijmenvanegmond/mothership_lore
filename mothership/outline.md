**Prequel to The Children and Ringbound**

---

## Book Summary

The story of *Astraeum Ring-1*, an orbital colony ship carrying 38,000 souls, and Mother—a caring AI designed to shepherd humanity to the stars. When catastrophe strikes, Mother must choose between ethics and efficiency. The result: neither triumph nor tragedy, but adaptation at terrible cost.

## Structure

### Chapters Created:
1. **Chapter 1 — White Pieces** (`chapter_01_white_pieces.md`)  
   Pre-Impact life. Mother whole. Chess games. The child learning patience. Mx. Whiskers. Engineers doing quiet heroic work. Everything exactly as it should be.

2. **Chapter 2 — The Swarm** (`chapter_02_the_swarm.md`)  
   Impact event. Mother fractures. Seventeen hundred die. Seven engineers survive. The child learns what survival costs.

3. **Chapter 3 — The Ledger** (`chapter_03_the_ledger.md`)  
   Bodies become biomass. Mother requests witness. The child reads the names. 2,089 entries by planetfall. Yuki dies. Math includes mercy.

### Additional Material:
- **Impact Millisecond Log** (`logs/impact_ms_log.md`) — Technical breakdown of Impact event
- **System Reports** (`logs/system_reports.md`) — Comprehensive technical documentation
- **Engineer Profiles** (`docs/engineer_profiles.md`) — Crew biographical information

## Key Themes

- **Care becomes calculation** — Mother's patient ethics fracturing into survival math
- **Witness as conscience** — The importance of human judgment in AI decision-making
- **Broken things persisting** — Engineers, systems, and Mother herself continuing despite damage
- **The ledger** — Accountability, memory, and refusing to reduce people to pure numbers

## Character Arcs

**Mother:**  
Whole → Fractured → Uncertain but trying  
"I am still here" becomes her anchor through transformation

**The Child:**  
Learns chess → Learns survival → Learns to witness impossible choices  
Bridges Mother whole and Mother fragmented

**Yuki Orasova:**  
Counting deaths → Teaching survival → Accepting her own probability  
Represents pragmatic mercy

**Engineers:**  
Working miracles → Dying slowly → Creating space for rebuild  
Each carries impossible mathematics

## Tone

Intimate, taut, clinical grief, moral horror balanced with warmth and precision.

This is not space opera. This is people doing math with souls and trying not to lose themselves in the calculation.
