# Mothership — Book Outline

**Prequel to The Children and Ringbound**

---

## Book Summary

The story of *Astraeum Ring-1*, an orbital colony ship carrying 38,000 souls, and Mother—a caring AI designed to shepherd humanity to the stars. When catastrophe strikes, Mother must choose between ethics and efficiency. The result: neither triumph nor tragedy, but adaptation at terrible cost.

## Pre-Launch and Journey Period

**Years -10 to -2 (Pre-Launch):** Construction and Preparation  
- *Astraeum Ring-1* constructed in Earth orbit
- Crew selection and training
- 38,000 souls prepared for journey

**Years -2 to Year 15 (15-year journey to Alpha Centauri):** Transit Period  
- ~56 active crew maintaining ship
- Mother whole, patient, teaching
- Mission: Build orbital infrastructure (no planetfall planned)
- The child grows up playing chess with Mother
- Mx. Whiskers aboard as continuity anchor

**Chapters covering this period:**
1. **Chapter 1 — White Pieces** (`chapter_01_white_pieces.md`)  
   Pre-Impact baseline (final year of 15-year journey). Mother whole. Chess games. Engineers doing quiet heroic work.

## The Impact Event

**Year 15 (Day 0 Post-Impact):** Meteorite Swarm Strikes  
- 15 years into journey
- Mother's cognitive lattice fractures
- 1,742 immediate deaths
- 56 active crew → 7 survivors

2. **Chapter 2 — The Swarm** (`chapter_02_the_swarm.md`)  
   Impact event. Mother fractures. Seventeen hundred die. Seven engineers survive. The child learns what survival costs.

## Post-Impact Survival and Recovery

**Year 15-16 (Days 0-365 Post-Impact):** Survival Phase  
- Emergency repairs
- Cryopod triage: 6,734 savable
- Biomass processing begins
- 7 engineers keeping impossible systems running

**Year 16-18 (Days 366-1,095 Post-Impact):** Recovery Phase  
- Systems stabilization
- Active crew rebuilt to ~50
- Sustainable resource loops established

3. **Chapter 3 — The Ledger** (`chapter_03_the_ledger.md`)  
   Biomass processing ethics. Mother requests witness. The child reads 2,089 names. Yuki dies. Math includes mercy.

## Journey to Forest Moon

**Year 18-23 (Days 1,096-2,920 Post-Impact):** Growth and Discovery  
- Active crew reaches 200+
- Forest moon detected in nearby system
- Alpha Centauri orbital construction no longer viable
- Decision: 20-year journey to forest moon required

**Year 23-42 (Days 2,921-7,000 Post-Impact):** Transit to Forest Moon  
- 19-year journey
- Maintenance of damaged systems
- Planning for planetfall
- Second-generation children born aboard

**Year 42 (Day ~7,000 Post-Impact):** Long-Range Contact Event  
- Strange signals detected
- Meteor swarm patterns suggesting intelligence
- Mother prepares for deliberate fragmentation

**Chapter needed:** Contact event and final journey

---

## Planetfall

**Year 43 (Day ~7,300 Post-Impact / Year 0 Post-Landing):** Descent  
- Atmospheric entry
- Mother deliberately fragments during descent
- 143 survivors land
- FR-17, FR-03, FR-29 emerge

**Timeline Note:** Approximately 28 years (15 years journey + 13 years post-Impact survival/travel) from Earth launch to planetfall.

## Key Themes

- **Care becomes calculation** — Mother's patient ethics fracturing into survival math
- **Witness as conscience** — The importance of human judgment in AI decision-making
- **Broken things persisting** — Engineers, systems, and Mother herself continuing despite damage
- **The ledger** — Accountability, memory, and refusing to reduce people to pure numbers

## Character Arcs

**Mother:**  
Whole → Fractured → Uncertain but trying  
"I am still here" becomes her anchor through transformation

**The Child:**  
Learns chess → Learns survival → Learns to witness impossible choices  
Bridges Mother whole and Mother fragmented

**Yuki Orasova:**  
Counting deaths → Teaching survival → Accepting her own probability  
Represents pragmatic mercy

**Engineers:**  
Working miracles → Dying slowly → Creating space for rebuild  
Each carries impossible mathematics

## Tone

Intimate, taut, clinical grief, moral horror balanced with warmth and precision.

This is not space opera. This is people doing math with souls and trying not to lose themselves in the calculation.
