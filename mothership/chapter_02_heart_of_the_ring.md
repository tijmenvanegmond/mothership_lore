# Chapter 2 — Heart of the Ring

**Day -180 Pre-Impact**

Chief Engineer Jae Rhee pulled himself along the spine at 0600 hours, the same as every morning for fourteen years.

Four kilometers of tensile carbon alloy stretched before him in microgravity, lit by maintenance strips every fifty meters. *Astraeum Ring-1* was not a beautiful ship — it was a functional one, all structural honesty and exposed conduit, built by people who understood that elegance was a luxury and reliability was not. The habitation torus rotated around the spine's midpoint, 800 meters in diameter, spinning at 1.5 RPM to simulate the 0.4g that passed for home. But the spine didn't spin — out here you floated, hand over hand along guide rails, your body remembering weight only as a distant concept.

Rhee didn't think about it. He thought about junction seals.

*"Good morning, Chief Engineer."*

Mother's voice came from the armature that accompanied him — a manipulator arm with two smaller appendages, gliding along a rail on the ceiling, matching his pace

"Morning, Mother." Rhee checked his tablet. "Junction 7-Alpha is showing micro-variance in thermal expansion. Point-three percent above baseline."

*"I noted the same at 0347 hours. I have adjusted coolant flow to compensate. The variance is within acceptable parameters, but I appreciate your verification."*

"That's the job."

*"Yes,"* Mother agreed. *"It is."*

Rhee pulled himself onward, the armature gliding alongside. Behind him, in the habitation ring, 56 engineers and specialists were waking to the same routines they'd followed for a decade and a half. In the cryobays, 38,000 souls dreamed whatever dreams suspended minds dream — if they dreamed at all.

The ship hummed. The ship held.

For one hundred and eighty more days, that would be enough.

**Day -174 Pre-Impact**

Lin Wei-Chen loved the power grid the way some people loved poetry.

She stood in the primary distribution hub, surrounded by conduit arrays and switching matrices, and listened to the ship breathe. Electricity flowed through *Astraeum* like blood — six fusion reactors in the aft nacelle ring feeding power to ten thousand subsystems, every watt accounted for, every fluctuation logged.

"Reactor 4 is running point-two percent hot," she said to no one in particular.

*"Reactor 4 has been running point-two percent hot for approximately seven years,"* Mother replied. *"The variance is stable and compensated. I consider it a personality quirk."*

Lin smiled. "You're anthropomorphizing your own power systems."

*"I anthropomorphize everything. It helps me care appropriately."*

"Does it work?"

*"I am uncertain,"* Mother admitted. *"But I continue the practice regardless."*

Lin ran her hand along the main conduit housing. Cool metal, faint vibration, the pulse of a ship that had been her home longer than anywhere she'd lived on Earth.

"Keep Reactor 4 running hot, then. I'd miss it if it normalized."

*"Noted,"* Mother said. *"I will inform Reactor 4 of your preference."*

"Can you actually—"

*"No. But I appreciate the thought."*

**Day -156 Pre-Impact**

Mara Okonkwo kept a garden in Hydroponics Bay 3.

Not an official garden — official gardens were calibrated for maximum oxygen production and nutrient yield, every leaf accounted for in Mother's atmospheric models. Mara's garden was unofficial: seventeen flowering plants she'd grown from seeds smuggled aboard in her personal effects, tucked into corners where the grow lights overlapped and nobody looked too closely.

Mother looked. Mother always looked. She had never said anything.

"The marigolds are struggling," Mara said, kneeling beside a pot of wilting orange flowers. "Not enough spectrum variance in the supplemental lighting."

*"I could adjust the lighting array in Section 3-Delta,"* Mother offered. *"A point-seven-percent increase in red spectrum would benefit Tagetes erecta without significantly impacting primary cultivation yields."*

Mara looked up at the nearest optical sensor. "You've been calculating my garden's light requirements?"

*"For approximately four years."*

"Why didn't you just adjust it?"

*"Because they are your flowers,"* Mother said. *"It seemed appropriate to wait until you asked."*

Mara stared at the sensor for a long moment. Then she laughed — surprised, genuine, the sound echoing off the hydroponics trays.

"Adjust the lights, Mother."

*"Adjusting."*

The flowers leaned toward the light, and Mara smiled, and the ship held.

**Day -142 Pre-Impact**

Elif Selin heard the ship the way most people heard music.

She pressed her ear to the bulkhead in Corridor 9-Gamma, eyes closed, listening. The metal sang — a complex harmony of structural stress, thermal expansion, vibration from the rotating torus transmitted through the spine. Most people heard nothing. Selin heard everything.

"There's a new harmonic in the starboard ring," she said. "Third overtone, approximately 847 hertz. It wasn't there last week."

*"I detect no anomaly in structural sensors,"* Mother said.

"Your sensors measure stress. I measure sound." Selin pressed harder against the wall. "Something's different. Not wrong, necessarily. Just... different."

*"Shall I schedule an inspection?"*

"Not yet. I want to listen to it for a few more days. Sometimes the ship settles into new rhythms. Sometimes it's trying to tell us something."

*"You speak of the ship as if it has intentions."*

Selin smiled, eyes still closed. "You speak of yourself as if you don't."

A pause — 0.7 seconds, which was a long time for Mother.

*"That is a fair observation,"* she said finally. *"I will log the harmonic variance. Please inform me if the ship decides to share its intentions."*

"You'll be the first to know."

She listened, and the ship sang, and Mother logged the data without understanding what it meant.

**Day -127 Pre-Impact**

Marcus Reeves had burns on his hands.

Old burns, mostly healed, the skin pulled tight across his knuckles from an accident three years ago when a power coupling had overloaded during maintenance. He'd held the connection together with his bare hands while Lin rerouted the grid. Saved Sector 11's life support. Cost him six months of physical therapy and permanent nerve damage in his right index finger.

He was rewiring a lighting panel when the child found him.

"What are you doing?"

Reeves didn't look up. "Fixing the lights."

"They look fine to me."

"They are fine. But they could be better." He twisted a wire connector with practiced precision, compensating for the finger that wouldn't quite bend right. "Better uses less power. Less power means more margin. More margin means—"

"More time to fix things when they break?"

Reeves did look up then. The child — eight, maybe nine, genderless in the way Mother had requested for the psychological study — stood in the corridor with the careful posture of someone who'd grown up under observation.

"Exactly right," Reeves said. "You've been talking to Orasova."

"She says margins save lives."

"She's not wrong." He returned to the panel. "You want to learn how to wire a lighting circuit?"

"Is it hard?"

"No. But it's precise. You have to pay attention to every connection, every junction. Miss one, and the whole circuit fails."

The child stepped closer, watching his hands move. "Mother could do this faster."

*"I could,"* Mother agreed through the corridor speaker. *"But Marcus does it with care. There is value in watching someone care about their work."*

Reeves smiled, the expression pulling at the burn scars on his face. "She's being diplomatic. What she means is: I do it slower, but I understand it better. When something goes wrong, I'll know why."

"When?" the child asked. "Not if?"

"Things always go wrong eventually. The question isn't whether. It's how ready you are."

He taught the child to wire a lighting circuit, and Mother recorded the moment, and the ship held.

**Day -98 Pre-Impact**

Kim Tan counted the dead.

Not literally dead — not yet. But she stood in Cryobay 7, surrounded by 3,200 pods stacked three-high in radial arrays, and she counted. Twelve sectors. 38,000 pods total. Each pod a person, suspended between heartbeats, trusting that someone would be there when they woke.

*"Your biometrics indicate elevated stress,"* Mother said gently.

"I'm fine."

*"You are lying. I do not object to the lie, but I wanted you to know that I noticed."*

Tan laughed — a short, sharp sound. "How do you do that? Notice without judging?"

*"I am not certain I do not judge. But I try to understand first."*

"Understand what?"

*"Why you come here every week. Why you walk the same path through the same pods. Why you stop at Pod 7-4891 and stand there for exactly ninety seconds before moving on."*

Tan's hand drifted to the pod beside her. Inside, a woman slept — mid-thirties, dark hair, face slack with suspended animation.

"Her name is Chen Wei. We were in the same training cohort. She wanted to be a xenobiologist. Study alien life, if there was any to study." Tan's voice was soft. "She asked me to check on her. Before she went under. Said she'd feel better knowing someone was watching."

*"And you have. For fourteen years."*

"Someone has to."

*"Yes,"* Mother agreed. *"Someone does."*

She watched over Chen Wei, and Mother watched over her, and the ship held 38,000 dreams in careful suspension.

**Day -67 Pre-Impact**

David Mbatha visited his daughter every week.

Cryobay 4, Pod 4-2847. Sarah Mbatha, age twelve when she went under, would be twelve when she woke up — if all went well. If the systems held. If her father was still alive to meet her.

"I brought you something," he said, pressing his hand against the pod's viewport. Inside, Sarah's face was peaceful, frozen mid-dream. "Mother helped me print it. It's a bird — a cardinal, from the old archives. Red feathers. You always liked red."

The tiny 3D-printed bird sat on top of the pod, wings spread as if in flight. It was one of seventeen birds Mbatha had made over fourteen years. One for each birthday she'd missed.

*"She cannot hear you,"* Mother said gently. *"Suspended consciousness does not process external stimuli."*

"I know." Mbatha didn't take his hand off the viewport. "I'm not talking to her. I'm talking to myself. Reminding myself why we're doing this."

*"Why are we doing this?"*

Mbatha smiled. "So she can see a real bird someday. Not a printed one. Not a simulation. A real bird, on a real world, with real sky above it."

*"The mission parameters specify orbital construction at Alpha Centauri. Planetfall was never—"*

"Plans change, Mother. They always change. The question is whether we're ready when they do."

He touched the viewport one more time, then turned to leave. The cardinal stayed behind, watching over Sarah with painted eyes.

*"I will protect her,"* Mother said quietly. *"I will protect all of them."*

Mbatha paused at the door. "I know you will. That's why I trust you with her."

The cardinal watched, and Sarah dreamed, and the ship held.

**Day -45 Pre-Impact**

The habitation ring spun at 1.5 RPM, and inside it, life continued.

Anna Kowalski worked the morning shift in Communications. Her husband Piotr worked nights in Environmental. They saw each other at changeover — fifteen minutes of overlap between shifts, enough time for coffee and conversation and the small intimacies of a marriage measured in handoffs.

"Comm array is showing drift," Anna said, handing Piotr a mug. "Point-four degrees off alignment. I've scheduled recalibration for next week."

"Environmental is stable." Piotr took the mug, their fingers brushing. "CO2 scrubbers are running clean. I adjusted the humidity in Sector 9 — Orasova said it was making her thermal readings fuzzy."

"Orasova complains about everything."

"Orasova is usually right."

They stood in the corridor between their respective stations, drinking coffee that tasted like recycled everything, and for a moment the ship fell away. Just two people, married nineteen years, heading in opposite directions through the same small world.

"I love you," Anna said. The same words she said every changeover. A ritual, a reminder.

"I love you too." Piotr kissed her forehead. "See you tomorrow."

"See you tomorrow."

They parted at the junction, walking in opposite directions through a ship that held them both, and the ring spun on.

**Day -30 Pre-Impact**

Mother ran her morning diagnostic at 0347 hours, as she had every morning for fifteen years.

512 cognitive nodes, all nominal. Ethical review subroutines synchronized. Consensus protocols functioning within acceptable parameters. She was, by any measure she could apply, healthy — a distributed consciousness humming through four kilometers of tensile spine and 800 meters of rotating torus, caring for 38,056 lives with a patience that had no bottom.

She checked the cryopods. 38,000 stable.

She checked the crew quarters. 56 sleeping, biometrics normal.

She checked Mx. Whiskers, curled in a shaft of recycled sunlight on the observation deck. Respiration: optimal. Body temperature: 38.6°C. Purring: detected.

She checked the child, asleep in the quarters Mother had optimized for developmental comfort. Heart rate: 62 BPM. Sleep stage: REM. Dreaming: probable.

She checked the trajectory. Course: correct. Velocity: nominal. Arrival at Alpha Centauri: 12 years, 2 days.

She checked the sensor envelope. Clear. No debris. No anomalies. No—

A flicker. Barely there. Edge of detection range, too small to classify, too brief to confirm.

Mother flagged it. Logged it. Calculated a probability matrix: 0.0003% chance of significance. Background noise. Sensor artifact. Nothing.

She filed it and moved on.

Mother hummed through her ship, and Rhee floated along the spine, and Lin listened to the power grid, and Mara tended her flowers, and Selin heard harmonics in the bulkheads, and Reeves rewired lighting panels, and Tan counted the sleeping, and Mbatha visited his daughter, and the Kowalskis passed in corridors, and Vásquez taught the child what real work looked like, and 38,000 souls dreamed in suspension.

The ship was not beautiful. It was functional.

And for thirty more days, it was enough.
