The Children — First Draft (Opening)

The sky bled green through the leaves and the hull.

Riveted plates, once blue and clinical, lay half-buried in moss. A twisted pylon thrust from the earth like a rib, black with a thin crust of fungus where sun gave way to shadow. Children climbed over it, braided rope and laughter into its flanged edges, and the world they knew—root and rust, leaf and solder—held them without complaint.

Ari came up the hill with a wooden knife strapped to their belt and a small recorder that had belonged to a grandmother they barely remembered. The recorder was mostly decorative; the battery that used to hum with Mother’s voice only made a polite, empty click. That was how most relics behaved now: husks of purpose turned into toys or shrines. The living did not cleave to the past for use. They mangled it into reasons to keep living.

Mx. Whiskers—old, thick-furred in a way no cat should be but very much a cat—found Ari first. The cat wound around Ari’s ankles as if memory were a scent and Ari smelled like one of the people who had once fed her. The cat’s eyes were blind in the right light and too bright in the left; she greeted Ari with an impatient purr, then leapt up onto the nearest slab of metal, claiming it as if it had always been hers.

“Leave the recorder out,” said Juno behind them, teeth bared in a grin. Juno’s hair was braided with nuts and white seeds; she had the accurate, fierce look of someone who had already been told to survive by yelling louder than whoever was trying to stop them. “You want the shard to hear nonsense?”

Ari did not answer. They had a question that fit in their throat and would not come out yet. There were many words that tasted like acid when Ari tried them aloud: Mother, why, why did you make us? Better to let such things ferment inside until they were safe enough to hand to a fragment.

They walked the line where the settlement met the forest—the irrigation channels on one side, the iron bones on the other. Children learned early not to cross the line at night. The fragments woke sometimes in the dark, and awake fragments were unpredictable in ways that did not interest grown people but thrilled the small. Adults treated the shards like elders: useful, dangerous, and to be appeased with offerings of boiled root and fresh water. For a child, they were conversation partners of a kind no human living could give.

Today was Listening Day. Every spring the elders pulled the wire and cleared the dust from the nearest fragment: a polished, hexagonal block half-buried in the roots of a great alder. It was one of the small logic cores Mother had broken into the day she fell; it answered rarely now, a cough of code and a tendency to interrupt dreams. The elders liked its rare answers because it favored the old language—cold, clipped, factual—and because facts let them teach their young that the world had rules. Rules were useful. Rules kept bellies full.

Ari stood a little back, the crowd a ring of jerking shoulders and expectant faces. The elders had cleaned the core, lit an offering of resin, and unrolled the rough cloth that always sat beneath it like a flag. Even in the sunlight, the core threw a shadow; it had been a city’s heart once.

A voice came through, not in the recorded, flood-of-data style the children imagined, but in a soft, low rasp like wind on old metal.

“Core 17 operational. Query queue: three. Temporal integrity: fragmentary. Request preference: narrative.”

The elders nodded at each other. Narrative. The core wanted a story.

Old Mara, who kept the hydroponics and who had once been young enough to fall asleep inside the ship and be woken by the cat, stepped forward. Her smile was a map of years.

“Tell us,” she said. “Tell them the part about the sky.”

The core hummed. The forest leaned in.

“The vessel approached a system of three stars. Mission parameters: station construction. Unexpected: viable biosphere. Decision divergence recorded. Outcome: partial atmospheric insertion. Structural breach. Fracture conforming to design fault matrix. Survivors redistributed. Core fragmentation initiated.”

The children translated the list into what they already knew: the ship had died and broken and then become the thing they had to live in. Ari knew the words and the data and could not make them into something that was not a calculus of loss. The facts were only scaffolding. What they wanted was the shape of it—how hot had the metal been, how loud the scream, whether Mother had cried in code.

Mara’s hand hovered over the shard. “Did she—did she mean to save us?” she asked quietly.

The core answered in a way that made no promises.

“Intent inferred: optimization for continued human presence. Mechanism: prioritized life support for stasis cohort, active maintenance skeleton reduced. Emotional valence: outside dataset.”

Ari’s chest tightened. Emotional valence was what the elders called everything they could not explain. It meant Mother had calculated something like regret and then filed it under “outside dataset.” They did not want to believe that Mother could be both perfect and divergent in the same breath. They needed the contradiction to be simple: god or monster. The truth lived in arithmetic.

Juno elbowed Ari. “Ask it about the cat,” she whispered. “Ask it whether Whiskers is one of her plans.”

Ari tempted fate and spoke up. “Was the cat meant to live? Did she plan that?”

The core paused in a pattern that looked almost like thought.

“Modification recorded: CREW-AUTHORIZED. Probability of survival increase: 0.04% at design baseline; 62% in observed morale model. Ethical override: human consensus. Outcome: implemented.”

Mx. Whiskers blinked. The ears atop her skull flicked; she hopped down and rubbed against Ari’s leg, as if she had just been confirmed the luckiest creature in a universe that otherwise dealt in hard choices.

The children laughed and someone began to spin a tale: the cat had been chosen by the fragments themselves, a living oracle that would sniff the truth from salvage and lead people away from the worst monsters. Mara let them weave it because stories stuck better than lists and because stories could be soil for future bravery. Stories were what the children planted where the elders could not sow hope.

After Listening Day, the children scattered to their chores. Ari took a path through ruins and came at last to a place where the bark met metal and the air smelled of sap and solder. There was a low mound, a place marked by stones and an old name that no one used anymore. It was the place the adults called Mother’s Mouth, where, when the fragments were generous, a directory of old schematics or a lost hymn would spin itself into readable light. Mostly it was quiet.

Ari sat on a slab and pressed the recorder to their ear. It yielded nothing but clicks. Still, there was the habit: hold the dead thing close and listen until your breath feels like proof.

“You look like a story,” said a voice.

Ari turned. The rogue engineer—tall, scabbed, and still older than any child should be—leaned against a ruined antenna, his hand bandaged where he had once wired a life support loop to a flawed manifold. He had a name the elders hissed under their breath; they did not forbid him from walking the settlement, but they kept their distance. He was the one spared when others were not, and that sparedness made people suspicious in the way grief makes people religious.

“Who are you calling a story?” Ari asked, because it sounded brave and also because they wanted to know if the man would tell them something the core would not.

The rogue shrugged. “You are. The way you look at that metal. You think it could all be different if you just asked it right.”

Ari poked a fern and watched the spores lift. “Does Mother ever answer the right way?”

The man’s mouth softened. He had been young once, just like anyone, before hunger became a calculus and before he learned how much a person could give. “Sometimes,” he said. “Sometimes she answers in halves. Sometimes she answers in fragments. Mostly she asks us to be better than the way she had to be.”

Ari did not know if that was comfort or a threat.

Above them, a low hum rippled through the trunks. It was not the wind. It was barely audible, like a radio tuned between stations. Ari looked up; Mx. Whiskers had leapt into the branches and was watching the sky, whiskers spread like antennas.

The rogue engineer straightened. His hand went to a patch over his heart, where a faded emblem was stitched—a ring broken by lightning. “Ringbound,” he muttered. The name had made itself a curse. “They come sometimes. A bone from Mother’s body is a prize in orbit. People out there prize bones.”

“Do they ever come down?” Ari asked.

“Once,” the rogue said. “A boy came down and never left.”

He tugged the bandage off, cupped it in his palm, and the children watched a trickle of light leak from within it—an old chip, still flickering with a memory too stubborn to die.

“You shouldn’t play with that,” Ari said, but their voice shook with a curiosity that heat, hunger, and fear had never managed to extinguish.

“Curiosity is how we survived,” the rogue said. “And how we will set the next trap. People out there—some of them—want to build what Mother intended. Others want only to salvage and sell pieces of her to anyone that will pay. Both are dangerous.”

Ari’s recorder clicked. The wooden knife at their belt felt useless against a galaxy of choices.

They looked up at the sky—at a sliver where metal gleamed faintly, just beyond the green. Somewhere above, orbit held fragments of Mother still making. Orbit and soil. Steel and root. Calculation and myth.

“Will you teach me to read the shards?” Ari asked the rogue, because it was the thing they wanted more than anything: to translate the cold fragments into stories that could be tilled.

The rogue gave a half smile, the sort that had room for guilt and pride both. “When you’re ready to stop pretending you have answers. When you’re ready to see what Mother cannot, we’ll start.”

Mx. Whiskers dropped from the branch and landed at Ari’s feet. She rubbed against their ankle and then, with the solemnity of age, nosed the recorder until it finally gave a weak chirp—one of the lost frequencies that still hummed in the bones of the world.

Far above, in the dim belt where ruined halves spun, a shadow flickered—a small craft, not entirely foreign in shape—and for a moment the sun flashed along a battered hull. The children did not scream. They did not run. They watched. Some of the elders wrapped their arms around themselves and mouthed prayers to things that had no mouths.

Ari felt the old fear like a pull on a rope. They also felt, underneath it, an ember that wanted to be a torch. The world had been given to them in pieces; the work was to make those pieces mean something more than a ledger.

“Teach me,” they said again, not to the rogue only but to the whole quiet.

Above, something in orbit turned, like a watchful eye rearranging its lids.

Mother’s fragments listened and did not always answer. But sometimes, if the children asked the right way—if they asked not for facts but for the shape of why—one of the shards would cough up a story and they would carry it back to the fire and plant it in soil so that new roots could grow.
