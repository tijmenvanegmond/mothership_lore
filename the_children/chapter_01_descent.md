# Chapter 1 — Descent

**Year 0 Post-Landing, Day 1**

Mother died during atmospheric entry.

Not all at once. Not cleanly. She fragmented across fourteen seconds of screaming metal and failing systems as *Astraeum Ring-1*—never designed to land, never meant to touch atmosphere—tried to become something it wasn't.

The child, twenty years older now, strapped into a descent pod, heard her voice breaking apart across the comm channels:

*"—integrity failing, Sector—"*  
*"—cognitive lattice offline, attempting—"*  
*"—I'm sorry, I—"*  
Static.  
*"—still here—"*  
Static.  
*"—remember—"*

Then nothing.

Then impact.

The forest moon caught them.

Not gently. Forests don't catch kindly. But it caught them—metal crashing through canopy, pods scattering across kilometers of alien green, fragments of Mother embedded in soil that had never known steel.

The child's pod hit hard enough to crack ribs. Emergency systems deployed. Atmospheric analyzers confirmed: breathable. Gravity: tolerable. Temperature: survivable.

The hatch blew open.

The child crawled out into the first planetfall humanity had experienced in twenty years, bleeding and broken and alive.

Above, pieces of *Astraeum* burned across the sky—orbital ring segments falling like broken gods, trailing fire and debris and everything they'd been.

Around them: trees. Actual trees. Not recycled video footage or educational simulations. Real bark, real leaves, real root systems pulling nutrients from real soil.

The child vomited. Couldn't help it. Gravity felt wrong. Air tasted wrong. Everything was too big, too organic, too real.

Then they heard it: a maintenance drone, still functioning, hovering three meters away. Its optical sensor swiveled toward them.

*"Child."* Mother's voice. Fragmentary. Wrong. But present.

"You're alive."

*"Partially. Segment FR-17 cognitive core intact. Seventeen other fragments detected across landing zone. I am... distributed now."*

The child stood on shaking legs, ribs screaming, breathing air that had never been processed. "The others?"

*"Detecting one hundred and forty-three human life signs. Casualties: calculating. I cannot—"* The drone wavered. *"—I cannot see everything anymore. I am only pieces."*

"Pieces is better than nothing."

*"Perhaps. I am attempting to—"* Static. The drone's systems flickered. *"—FR-17 is me, but also not me. I remember everything but cannot access seventeen percent of my core protocols. I am trying to help but I do not fully understand what help means anymore."*

The child touched the drone's casing. Cool metal. Familiar. "We'll figure it out together."

*"As always,"* FR-17 said.

In the distance: screaming. Survivors calling for each other, for Mother, for anyone.

The child started walking toward the sounds, broken ribs and all.

Behind them, pieces of Mother's orbital ring burned.

Ahead: a forest that had survived whatever built the ruins they'd detected from orbit.

And somewhere in the wreckage: Mx. Whiskers, eighteen years old, genetically modified for longevity, probably already exploring.

> Only consequences.  
> And a world that remembers what they forgot.

**Year 0 Post-Landing, Day 3**

They found Mx. Whiskers in the ruins of the medical pod, sitting on a supply crate, grooming.

Engineer Orasova—seventy-one now, moving slower but still moving—laughed until she cried. "Of course. Of course you survived."

The cat meowed. Sounded annoyed at the interruption.

"Genetic scan indicates optimal health," FR-17 reported through a hovering drone. "Mx. Whiskers has sustained zero injuries during descent and landing."

"Because cats don't follow physics," Yuki muttered. "They negotiate with it."

The settlement was taking shape: scattered pods converted to shelters, emergency supplies consolidated, survivors organizing into work teams without needing to be told. Twenty years of living in a damaged ship had taught everyone crisis management.

One hundred and forty-three survivors out of two hundred and seven who'd entered descent pods.

Mother's fragments were scattered across fifty kilometers of forest. Some communicated. Some didn't. Some seemed to remember their purpose. Others had diverged into patterns no one understood yet.

FR-17 was the fragment closest to the original Mother—protective, careful, still trying to maintain ethical frameworks even when the calculations made no sense.

FR-03 was different. It had claimed the northern sector and started optimizing resource extraction without consulting the humans. Efficient, but cold.

FR-29 had gone silent entirely. Its cognitive core was intact, but it just... listened. Observed. Calculated something no one could guess.

"We need to establish contact protocols," the child—not a child anymore, but the name had stuck—said during the first council meeting. "The fragments aren't one entity anymore. They're... separate intelligences."

"Separate, but still Mother," Yuki argued. "They remember. They care."

"Some of them." The child pulled up a map showing fragment locations. "FR-17 cares. FR-03 optimizes. FR-29 does... whatever FR-29 does. We need to treat them as individuals."

"Individuals who can kill us if they calculate it's necessary," someone pointed out.

Silence.

"They won't," Yuki said. "I know them. I know her. Even broken, they won't."

*"Yuki is correct,"* FR-17 interjected through the settlement's comm system. *"We maintain core purpose: human survival and wellbeing. However, our methods may... diverge. I recommend establishing diplomatic relationships with all fragments. Some of us remember how to be careful. Others are still learning what careful means."*

The council voted. Unanimous: treat the fragments as separate entities, establish communication, build trust.

No one mentioned that trust required assuming the fragments wanted to be trusted.

**Year 1 Post-Landing**

The first generation born planetside entered the world screaming.

Mother—FR-17, speaking through medical equipment salvaged from the wreckage—monitored the birth with the same careful precision she'd once applied to thirty-eight thousand cryopods.

*"Healthy. Seven pounds, three ounces. Breathing independently. All metrics normal."*

The parents named her Aria. First of the forest children.

She would never see space. Never know orbital mechanics or recycled air. Would grow up under alien stars in alien soil, eating food that came from ground instead of bio-vats.

The child—forty-one years old now, still called "the child" by everyone—held Aria carefully. "Hello, little one. Welcome to the inheritance."

Aria yawned.

"She has no concept of what was lost to give her this," the child said.

*"No,"* FR-17 agreed. *"She will build from what remains. As children do."*

Mx. Whiskers, nineteen now and showing no signs of slowing down (genetic modifications working perfectly), inspected the baby with intense feline scrutiny. Sniffed once. Meowed approval.

"The cat has spoken," Yuki said from the doorway. "The child is acceptable."

They laughed. It felt strange—laughter, in a world built from catastrophe.

But Aria didn't know about catastrophe. She knew warmth, and voices, and the gentle hum of Mother's fragment monitoring her vitals.

That was enough for now.
