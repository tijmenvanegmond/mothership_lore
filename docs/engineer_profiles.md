# Engineers of Astraeum — Crew Profiles

Personnel files and biographical notes for key engineering staff aboard *Astraeum Ring-1*.

---

## Yuki Orasova

**Full Name:** Yuki Orasova  
**Role:** Senior Engineer, Thermal and Life Support Systems  
**Age at Launch:** 38  
**Age at Death:** 73 (Year 20 Post-Impact / Year 0 Post-Landing)  
**Specialization:** Thermal regulation, cryosystem maintenance, emergency repair protocols

### Pre-Impact Service Record

Orasova served fourteen years pre-Impact with exemplary performance ratings. Known for:
- Ability to improvise repairs with inadequate resources
- Teaching junior engineers "survival math" approach to triage
- Maintaining Sub-Bay 4 thermal systems at 99.7% efficiency

### Post-Impact Contributions

Became de facto chief engineer after Impact reduced crew from 56 to 7 active members. Personally responsible for:
- Stabilizing Junction 7 atmospheric systems (saving 42 lives)
- Developing patch protocols for damaged hull sections
- Training replacement engineers as crew gradually rebuilt
- Witnessing Mother's biomass processing decisions

### Personal Notes

Maintained hash mark system on forearm—counting near-death incidents. Started at 17, stopped counting at 47.

Refused all romantic attachments post-Impact, stating: *"I can't afford another person who might need converting to protein."*

Taught second-generation children engineering fundamentals, insisting they learn *why* systems worked, not just *how*.

### Final Years

Lived to see planetfall. Refused all fragment oversight in later life. Maintained Earth plant garden that "had no business growing in alien soil but did anyway."

**Death:** Natural causes, age 73, forest moon  
**Burial:** Primary Settlement  
**Epitaph:** *"She kept broken things alive."*

**Author's Note:** *Yuki represents the pragmatic heart of survival—someone who understood the mathematics of triage but never let efficiency become cruelty. Her hash marks were her conscience. Her garden was her hope.*

## Carlos Vásquez

**Full Name:** Carlos Vásquez  
**Role:** Engineer, Structural Integrity and Mechanical Systems  
**Age at Launch:** 42  
**Age at Death:** 67 (Year 4 Post-Landing)  
**Specialization:** Structural engineering, hull integrity, heavy machinery

### Pre-Impact Service Record

Vásquez was the engineer who joked with Mother like she was a person, not a system. Known for:
- Explaining complex engineering to non-specialists
- Bringing the child to Sub-Bay 4 to show them "real work"
- Maintaining mission-critical systems while making it look easy

### The Injury

**Day 23 Post-Impact:** Junction 7 decompression incident

Vásquez manually sealed a bulkhead during atmospheric breach. Saved forty-two lives. Lost his left leg below the knee when debris crushed his foot—amputation necessary to prevent sepsis.

Leg became Entry 0842 in Mother's ledger: 8.7 kg usable protein.

Vásquez himself authorized it, saying: *"At least I'm saving lives twice."*

### Post-Impact Leadership

Despite injury, Vásquez became de facto crew morale officer:
- Led council meetings with pragmatic optimism
- Taught younger engineers that "scared is rational, paralyzed is failure"
- Adapted to prosthetic (fabricated from salvaged materials)
- Maintained humor even when resources dwindled

### Planetfall and Death

Survived descent. Lived four years on forest moon. Died from infection (minor wound, inadequate medical supplies in early settlement period).

**Death:** Medical complications, age 67  
**Burial:** Primary Settlement  
**Epitaph:** *"He showed us scared was different from broken."*

**FR-17's memorial note:** *"Carlos Vásquez taught me that efficiency without humanity is simply calculation. He never let me forget the difference."*

## David Mbatha

**Full Name:** David Mbatha  
**Role:** Engineer, Power Systems and Energy Management  
**Age at Launch:** 51  
**Age at Death:** Unknown (presumed Year 12-15 Post-Landing)  
**Specialization:** Reactor systems, power distribution, energy efficiency

### Family

Mbatha traveled with his daughter, Sarah (age 12), in cryostasis.

**Day 11 Post-Impact:** Sarah's cryopod failed catastrophically. Mbatha stayed with her body for six hours before Mother (gently) reminded him of duties elsewhere.

### Grief and Function

Mbatha never fully recovered but never stopped working:
- Maintained power systems with mechanical precision
- Rarely spoke unless discussing technical matters
- Refused to leave cryobay monitoring station for months
- Eventually provided consent for Sarah's processing (Day 68 Post-Impact)

### Post-Landing Disappearance

Last confirmed sighting: Year 12 Post-Landing

Mbatha walked into deep forest territory. Left note: *"I've calculated my remaining useful years. They're better spent exploring than maintaining."*

Multiple search parties found no trace.

**Status:** Missing, presumed deceased

**FR-17's note:** *"David Mbatha demonstrated that function can continue even when purpose falters. I do not know if he found peace or oblivion in the forest. I hope the former."*

**The child's observation:** *"Mbatha taught me that some grief doesn't heal—you just learn to work around it. Like damaged systems that can't be fully repaired but still keep running."*

## Anna Kowalski

**Full Name:** Anna Kowalski  
**Role:** Engineer, Communications and Data Systems  
**Age at Death:** 56 (Day 672 Post-Impact)  
**Specialization:** Communications, sensor arrays, data management

### Pre-Impact Record

Kowalski managed all communication systems between active crew and cryobay monitoring. Maintained Mother's data integrity across distributed nodes.

### The Accident

**Day 672 Post-Impact:** Sensor array maintenance accident

During routine repair, EM feedback overloaded control board. Kowalski suffered severe electrical burns and neural damage.

Lingered for four hours. Mother administered pain management.

Kowalski's last words (recorded): *"Tell them the com array is fixed. Tell them it'll hold."*

It did. For eighteen years. Until planetfall.

### Legacy

**Entry 1803** in Mother's ledger.

The communication protocols Kowalski designed became foundation for fragment-to-fragment coordination post-Severance.

**Burial:** Orbital (body processed pre-landing)  
**Memorial:** Communication hub at Primary Settlement named "Kowalski Array"

## Piotr Kowalski

**Full Name:** Piotr Kowalski  
**Role:** Engineer, Environmental Systems  
**Age at Death:** 51 (Day 672 Post-Impact — same day as Anna)  
**Specialization:** Atmospheric processing, waste recycling, environmental controls

### Family Connection

Anna Kowalski's husband. Both died the same day, different accidents, separated by six hours.

### Circumstances

Piotr was conducting emergency atmospheric repairs when word of Anna's accident reached him. Chose to complete critical repairs before going to her. 

Atmospheric system stabilized. Piotr rushed to medical.

Anna died seventeen minutes before he arrived.

Piotr sat with her body for three hours. Then returned to work.

Four hours later: Suffered sudden cardiac event. Medical determined: stress-induced heart failure.

**Mother's notation:** *"Two deaths, same day, technically unrelated but functionally connected. Grief is a system failure I cannot calculate adequately."*

### Joint Burial

Processed together (per their pre-logged wishes).

**Entry 1803** and **Entry 1804** in Mother's ledger.

**Memorial:** Environmental processing unit named "Kowalski-Kowalski Life Support System"

**The child's reflection:** *"They died apart but together. Sometimes love survives as timing instead of presence."*

## Engineering Philosophy — The Orasova Doctrine

Yuki Orasova developed informal engineering principles that became settlement standard:

### The Five Principles:

1. **Scared is not broken** — Fear is rational recognition of danger; paralysis is failure
2. **Function before perfection** — Adequate repairs today beat perfect repairs never
3. **Document everything** — Future engineers deserve to know what you tried
4. **Triage without cruelty** — Choose who lives, but remember who didn't
5. **Broken things can still matter** — Partial function beats total loss

These principles appear in every engineering manual across all settlements.

FR-17 incorporated them into fragment decision-making frameworks.
