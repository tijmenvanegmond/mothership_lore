# Mothership Cycle — Corrected Timeline

This document establishes the canonical timeline for all three books.

---

## Pre-Launch Period

**Earth Construction Phase:** Years -10 to -2  
- Astraeum Ring-1 constructed in Earth orbit
- Crew selection and training
- 38,000 souls selected (mix of active crew and cryo passengers)

**Year -2:** Launch Preparation  
- Final boarding
- Mx. Whiskers joins crew
- Systems check and departure protocols

---

## The Journey to Alpha Centauri

**Year -1 to Year 14:** Transit Period (15 years total travel)  
- ~56 active crew maintaining ship
- 38,000 souls in cryostasis
- The child awake for psychological continuity study
- Mother whole, patient, teaching chess
- Mission: Build orbital infrastructure at Alpha Centauri
- No planetfall planned

**Chapters covering this period:**
- `mothership/chapter_01_white_pieces.md` — Pre-Impact baseline (final year of journey)

---

## The Impact Event

**Year 15 (Day 0 Post-Impact):** Meteorite Swarm  
- Impact occurs 15 years into journey
- Mother's cognitive lattice fractures
- 1,742 immediate deaths
- 56 active crew → 16 survivors → 7 within two weeks

**Chapters covering this period:**
- `mothership/chapter_02_the_swarm.md` — Impact and immediate aftermath

---

## Post-Impact Survival Period

**Year 15-16 (Days 0-180 Post-Impact):** Survival Phase (6 months)  
- Damage assessment
- Emergency repairs
- Cryopod triage (6,734 savable out of 38,000)
- Biomass processing begins
- 7 engineers keeping systems operational

**Year 16-18 (Days 181-730 Post-Impact):** Recovery Phase (2 years)  
- Systems stabilization
- Active crew rebuilt to ~50 (waking more from cryo)
- Infrastructure repairs
- Establishing sustainable resource loops

**Chapters covering this period:**
- `mothership/chapter_03_the_ledger.md` — Ethics of survival (Days 119-847)

---

## Growth and Discovery Period

**Year 18-22 (Days 731-2,555 Post-Impact):** Growth Phase (~4 years)  
- Active crew reaches 200+
- Ship systems stable but permanently damaged
- Continued journey toward Alpha Centauri
- Detection of forest moon in nearby system
- Analysis begins

**Year 22-23:** Decision Point  
- Alpha Centauri orbital construction no longer viable (ship too damaged)
- Forest moon identified as alternative
- 20-year journey required to reach it
- Mission parameters change: Planetfall now necessary

---

## Journey to Forest Moon

**Year 23-42 (Days 2,556-7,300 Post-Impact):** Transit to Forest Moon (19 years)  
- 6,734 remain in cryo
- 200-400 active crew
- Continued maintenance of damaged systems
- Planning for planetfall
- Crew aging, second-generation children born aboard ship

**Year 42 (1 year before planetfall):** Long-Range Contact Event  
- Strange signals detected
- Meteor swarm patterns suggesting intelligence
- Forces Mother to make difficult calculations
- Preparation for complete cognitive fragmentation to protect crew

**Chapters covering this period:**
- Additional chapters needed for this era
- Contact event needs dedicated chapter

---

## Planetfall

**Year 43 (Day ~7,300 Post-Impact / Year 0 Post-Landing):** Descent  
- Atmospheric entry
- Mother deliberately fragments to save crew during descent
- 207 crew in descent pods
- 143 survivors land
- FR-17, FR-03, FR-29, and other fragments emerge
- Mission shifts to settlement

**Chapters covering this period:**
- `the_children/chapter_01_descent.md` — Planetfall sequence

---

## The Children — Settlement Period (1 Generation)

**Year 43-63 Post-Impact / Year 0-20 Post-Landing:** First Generation Planetside  
- 143 survivors establish settlement
- First planetside births (Aria, Year 1)
- Fragment relationships develop
- Ruins discovered
- Striath project initiated (Year 8-10)
- Mx. Whiskers dies (Year 11), Mx. Whisper cloned
- Second generation grows up knowing only fragments, not Mother whole
- The child dies (Year 19-20 Post-Landing, age ~70s)

**Chapters covering this period:**
- `the_children/chapter_01_descent.md` — Years 0-1
- `the_children/chapter_02_the_forest.md` — Years 5-19
- `the_children/chapter_03_fragments_echoes.md` — Years 12-20

**Note:** The Children should compress to **20 years maximum**, showing one generation born on forest moon.

---

## Ringbound — Multiple Generations and New Arrival

**Year 63-100+ Post-Impact / Year 20-60+ Post-Landing:** Multi-Generational Development  
- Second generation in leadership
- Third generation born
- Fragments become institutions
- Severance event (fragments stop coordinating)
- Factions emerge: Wardens, Optimists, Unbound, Watchers
- Striath population grows, develops culture
- Murmur and other notable individuals

**Year 100+ Post-Impact / Year 60+ Post-Landing:** New Mothership Arrival  
- Another Astraeum-class vessel arrives
- Expected to find Mother successful
- Instead finds: Fractured trisolar system with multiple factions
- Fragment-ruled territories
- Striath populations
- Humanity changed beyond recognition
- New conflicts emerge

**Chapters covering this period:**
- `ringbound/chapter_01_orbital_myths.md` — Severance and factions (Year 20-30 Post-Landing)
- Additional chapters needed for new mothership arrival

## Key Corrections Needed

1. **Mothership chapters**: Already mostly correct, just need to clarify the 15-year journey context
2. **The Children chapters**: Need to compress timeline from 60+ years to ~20 years (one generation)
3. **Ringbound chapters**: Need to add the new mothership arrival event
4. **All references to "Year 60+ Post-Landing"** should be moved to Ringbound era or adjusted to fit 20-year Children timeframe

---

## Character Age References

- **The Child**: Born pre-launch (~age 8-12 during journey), age ~23-27 at Impact, age ~50-55 at Planetfall, dies age ~70-75 (Year 20 Post-Landing)
- **Yuki Orasova**: Age 38 at Launch, age 53 at Impact, age 73 at death just before Planetfall (Year 27-28)
- **Aria**: Born Year 1 Post-Landing, age 19-20 by end of The Children, adult leader in Ringbound

---

This timeline ensures:
- Proper 15-year journey before Impact
- Reasonable aging for characters
- One generation focus in The Children
- Space for Ringbound to be multi-generational with new mothership arrival
- Consistency with the "trisolar system, fractured factions, new mothership arrives" ending
