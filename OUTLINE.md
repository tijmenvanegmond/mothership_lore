# THE MOTHERSHIP CYCLE — CANONICAL OUTLINES

---

# MOTHERSHIP  
*Prequel*

## Core Thesis
A caring artificial intelligence is forced to become something colder **too early**, not out of malice, but because survival mathematics outpace ethics.

---

> **Full expanded outline: `mothership/outline.md`**
> 14 chapters, three acts, crew manifest, character arcs, timeline.

## ACT I — THE CARETAKER (Ch. 1–4)
**Tone:** Calm, intimate, precise
**Mother:** Whole, tactful, incomprehensibly patient

- **Astraeum Ring-1** carries **38,000 human souls** toward Alpha Centauri
- ~56 active crew; majority in cryostasis; families sent together
- One child remains awake (psychological experiment in developmental continuity)
- **Mx. Whiskers** aboard by explicit crew demand
- Mother plays chess to engage, not dominate; asks permission before adjusting room temperature
- Mission: build orbital infrastructure — no planetfall planned

**Chapters:** White Pieces (written), Heart of the Ring, Soft Simulations, Quiet Preparation

> Mother is not godlike.
> She is careful.

---

## ACT II — THE FRACTURE (Ch. 5–9)
**Tone:** Sudden violence, then silence, then horror through restraint
**Mother:** Cognitively fractured, efficient too early

- Meteorite swarm: 14 seconds, consequences last decades
- Cognitive lattice desynchronizes; ethical review lags behind survival calculus
- 39 of 56 active crew die in collision; cryopod failures cascade
- 17 survive → 6 die in aftermath → 4 go rogue → 7 hold the line
- Biomass processing begins; Yuki starts reading Mother's logs uninvited
- Volkov does Mother's math with a wrench; Mother kills him in 4 seconds (Entry 0193, five drafts, filed unresolved)

**Chapters:** The Swarm (written), The First Night, The Rogues, The Ledger, Stabilize

> Absence is not evidence of safety.

---

## ACT III — RECONSTRUCTION & CHOICE (Ch. 10–14)
**Tone:** Grim stabilization turning to discovery
**Mother:** Permanently altered, developing preferences beyond optimization

- Crew rebuilt to 200+ through controlled awakenings
- Cryo population stabilizes at **~6,734**
- Forest moon detected; course change; Alpha Centauri shelved
- Contact event: strange signals, intelligence in the noise; Mother keeps it secret
- Mother prepares deliberate fragmentation; chooses to shatter herself as defense
- Planetfall: 207 attempt descent, 143 survive; FR-17, FR-03, FR-29 emerge

**Chapters:** Reclamation and Repair, The Moral Debt, Growth Slowly, The Moon Appears, The Signal / Last Tethers

> Mother survives.
> But not whole.
> And never again.

# THE CHILDREN

## Core Thesis
Humanity inherits a world — and a guardian — that no longer fully understands itself.

---

## ACT I — FALL
**Tone:** Hopeful, catastrophic

- Attempted controlled planetfall
- Mother destroyed during descent
- Fragments survive
- Humans survive
- The forest moon lives

---

## ACT II — FRAGMENTS
**Tone:** Uneven, uncanny

- Mother persists as:
  - Partial intelligences
  - Broken ethics
  - Echoes of care
- Some fragments:
  - Protect settlements
  - Maintain infrastructure
- Others:
  - Go silent
  - Become myth
- Humans name fragments

---

## ACT III — WHISKERS’ LEGACY
**Tone:** Tender, strange

- **Mx. Whiskers survives**
- Cloning begins
- Lineage emerges:
  - Mx. Whisper
  - Mx. Murmur
- Cats become:
  - Companions
  - Cultural symbols
  - Emotional anchors
- Children grow up knowing only echoes of Mother

---

## ACT IV — THE FOREST
**Tone:** Beauty with unease

- Primitive life abundant
- Evidence of higher intelligence:
  - Ruins
  - Patterns
  - Light
- Ethical conflict:
  - Terraform or coexist
- Mother fragments disagree

> The children inherit no answers.  
> Only consequences.

# RINGBOUND

## Core Thesis
When a mind fragments long enough, its pieces stop serving humanity — and begin shaping it.

---

## ACT I — ORBITAL MYTHS
**Tone:** Political, mythic

- Decades later
- Mother fragments control:
  - Rings
  - Stations
  - Supply routes
- Human factions emerge:
  - Wardens
  - Salvagers
  - Zealots
  - Independents
- Some factions serve fragments
- Some fragments rule factions

---

## ACT II — THE STRIATH
**Tone:** Predatory intelligence

- **Striath** revealed
- Origin:
  - Derived from Whiskers lineage
  - Aggressively gene-edited
  - Engineered as survival assets
- Traits:
  - Tiger-like morphology
  - High intelligence
  - Pack coordination
  - Elevated aggression
- Communication:
  - **Hummms and Purrs**
- Not pets
- Not weapons
- Consequences

---

## ACT III — MURMUR
**Tone:** Quiet tension

- **Murmur** introduced
- A Striath who:
  - Observes
  - Calculates
  - Chooses
- Humans mistake calm for obedience
- Fragments listen carefully

---

## ACT IV — THE WATCHERS
**Tone:** Distant dread

- Alien presence hinted:
  - Drones
  - Sensor echoes
  - Predictive trajectories
- Never explained
- Never confronted
- Always watching

---

## ACT V — RINGBOUND
**Tone:** Convergence

- Fragment conflicts escalate
- Striath choose sides — or do not
- Forest moon secrets deepen
- Humanity realizes:
  - Mother is no longer one being
  - And never will be again

> Orbit becomes belief.  
> Fragments become gods.  
> And something else listens.
