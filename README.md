## Core Themes

**MOTHERSHIP:** Care becoming calculation. Witness as conscience. Broken things persisting.

**THE CHILDREN:** Inheritance without answers. Fragments developing agency. The forest remembers.

**RINGBOUND:** Fragments become institutions. Orbit becomes mythology. Patterns completing.

## The Story So Far

*Astraeum Ring-1* carries 38,000 souls to Alpha Centauri. Mother—a patient, caring AI—shepherds them through void. Then: meteorite swarm. Impact. Fracture. Mother breaks into pieces that remember being whole but can't agree on what that meant.

Seven engineers survive. 6,734 remain in cryo. Bodies become biomass. Survival requires mathematics that outpace ethics.

Twenty years later: planetfall on a forested moon. Mother fragments during descent. Humans survive. Fragments persist. The Striath are engineered. Factions form. Myths replace memory.

And something in the ancient ruins keeps watching, waiting for a pattern only FR-29 seems to understand.

> Mother is not godlike.  
> She is careful.
>
> The children inherit no answers.  
> Only consequences.
>
> And something else listens.
